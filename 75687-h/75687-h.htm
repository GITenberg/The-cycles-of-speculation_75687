<h2 class="nobreak">I<br>Introduction</h2>
</div>

<p>The first step in the education of the speculator should be to clear
away the illusions which have grown rank through ignorance, and
flourished through prejudice. We have heard, and continue to hear, a
great deal of ethical talk on this subject, most of which emanates from
people who are not authorities, and who have little real conception
of the subject. It would be pretty safe to assume that a majority of
these same instructors speculate themselves. They place an arbitrary
construction on the word however, and draw a dividing line between
stock or cereal operations, and other forms of speculation, although
the basic principle is the same in all cases, i.e.: to buy what is
cheap and re-sell at a profit. One of the most ridiculous forms which
this pedantry assumes is the warning and preaching against speculation
by very rich men who made their own money speculating and could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
possibly have acquired it in any other way. Such expressions of opinion
are born largely of an exaggerated ego.</p>

<p>The trouble with these critics and advisers is that they seldom
approach the subject in the right way. With a full knowledge of
the fact that speculation is an inherent part of human nature, and
that a majority of human beings are bound to indulge in it in spite
of everything, these sophists simply rail against the practice
indiscriminately instead of attempting to point out what is foolish
and fallacious. If we attack the practice in a general way little
will be accomplished. If we say, “do not speculate,” our audience
will perchance give us a respectful hearing,—and go on speculating.
If, however, we point out what is dangerous and unreasonable, confine
ourselves to attacking the evils and explaining the delusions,
some good may be done in an educational way. We may, if we show by
simple logic that the education and qualifications necessary to
success are too difficult to acquire, actually deter many people
from speculating in certain lines at all, a thing which could not
possibly be accomplished by mere blanket warnings against the practice.
One of the most serious blunders in the world is the common one of
under-estimating other people’s intelligence. People are ready and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
willing to learn, and that they do learn is shown by the decreasing
crop of lambs. It is not nearly so easy for the dishonest promoters and
manipulators to market poor securities at high prices today as it was a
few years ago. And in this regard it may be pointed out that the press
has actually, although in many instances unconsciously, accomplished
a great deal on exactly the lines suggested above. Magazines and
newspapers have, in recent years, taken on an educational character.
Periodicals once devoted to fiction or history now deal largely with
business and social economics, and with the exposure of bad methods in
high places, the ruthless uncovering of false or misleading statistics,
and the simplification of questions hitherto involved; the public has
been gaining rapidly in education and understanding. The fact that much
space in leading periodicals is devoted to these subjects, is in itself
<i>prima facie</i> evidence that the people can and will learn, for
with all due credit to the editors and publishers, it is certain that
the contents of magazines and newspapers are selected in accordance
with what the public demands and likes.</p>

<p>No one will attempt to deny that a majority of public speculators lose.
In a former volume, the present writer undertook to establish by
analysis of a large number of public accounts, the fact that 80% of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the participators lost money. A number of critics commented on this
statement as a body blow to speculation, asserting that the writer
had shown that there was “80% against the player.” These writers
proceeded to compare this percentage with that existing in games of
pure chance, such as roulette, faro, etc., and wound up by pointing out
the tremendous drawback to the speculator through percentage against
the player. It seems incredible that any sane man should fall into such
laughable confusion of ideas. The percentage of players who lose in
any game has nothing to do with the percentage against the player. If
these critics established anything at all, it was that speculation was
not gambling; for it requires only a moment’s reflection to see that
in any mechanical gambling game where there is <i>any</i> percentage,
no matter how small, in favor of the game, the percentage of players
who eventually lose must be 100. This being the case, the gentlemen
mentioned were at considerable pains to prove that, as 100 per cent. of
the players did not lose, speculation was not a gambling game in the
strict sense of the word. That is to say, it could not be correctly
compared with any mechanical device where the element of skill was absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
If we consider the matter in a gambling light, the percentage against
the speculator can be determined by the proportions of commissions,
interest, taxes, etc., to capital invested. Taking commission alone as
our basis, we will find that he who purchases a stock at $100 a share
and pays one-quarter of one per cent. commission, has a percentage
against him of one-quarter of one per cent. If the speculator trades
on limited margins the drawback increases accordingly. If we assume
that 100 shares of stock are purchased in a bucket-shop on a one point
margin, without intention or ability to “re-margin” the transaction,
the mechanical percentage is large (25%); if 10 points margin is
deposited, the mechanical percentage is reduced to 2½%, etc. In the
first instance, $25 or 25% of the $100 involved was lost when the
transaction was recorded, without any change in market price. In the
second instance, $25 was again lost or 2½% of the $1,000 involved.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that fluctuations in prices of securities, cereals
and staples are frequently used as a basis for mere gambling
transactions. But the most remarkable feature of the whole problem is
the fact that the percentage of loss in transactions is <i>greater</i>
than the mechanical percentage. In the work already mentioned, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
writer undertook to establish this. In 500 accounts examined, there
was a loss of $1,245,000, and profits of $288,000, leaving a deficit
of $957,000. The commission charges and interest amounted to only
$275,000. There thus appeared a loss of $682,000 which could not be
attributed to a gambling percentage. It may be added that the period
considered in the computations was from July, 1901, to March, 1903, and
that the price of the stock considered (U. S. Steel Common) was the
same at the beginning and the end of the period.</p>

<p>This tends to again refute the theory of mere gambling, with a ruinous
percentage against the player, for no mechanical device could by any
possibility operate against the player to a greater extent than the
fixed percentage in favor of the machine. A gambling machine will stick
to its knitting. If, for example, we take the simplest form of gambling
device—two dice thrown from a cup,—we know that certain numbers
formed by adding the total spots which appear uppermost will show more
frequently than others. Thus the number two can be effected in but one
way, the number three in two ways, the number four in three ways, and
so on up to the number seven, which can be formed by six different
combinations, thus:

<p class="no-indent">from which point the chances decrease until the
number 12 can be formed in only one way—two sixes. This proposition
applies to all forms of mechanical gambling, and is so simple in
principle, and so distinct in operation that if we make a fair number
of casts, say 1,000, and do not make more sevens than any other one
number, we may be positive that the dice are defective, or loaded.</p>

<p>Therefore, if percentages hold true, we must attribute the surplus loss
in speculation to mental operations. In the total results mentioned,
these mental operations were so erroneous as to cause a loss greater
than the percentage itself; but, on the other hand, a certain number of
accounts showed profits; that is to say, the percentage was overcome,
which is again an obvious impossibility in true gambling.</p>

<p>The conclusion is offered, therefore, that not only can poor methods
and imperfect understanding result in losses far in excess of a
demonstrated drawback, but that this drawback may be overcome by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
other and more correct methods. It is difficult to understand why
the opponents of speculation are continually harping on these points
of gambling and percentage as bearing particularly on operations in
stocks or commodities. If a man buys a certain security because it is
cheap, or because he considers it cheap, and pays a certain commission
to a broker for effecting the transaction, he is no more playing a
percentage game than if he purchases a piece of real estate because it
is cheap and pays the real estate broker a commission for his services.</p>

<p>Marginal trading is another abomination of the anti-speculative
element, but here again the critics do not discriminate between use and
abuse. Trading on insufficient margin is one of the greatest evils in
the speculative world and when, as is frequently the case, this evil
is combined with lack of knowledge as to values and conditions, the
result is certain loss. But what is objected to here is the hazy view
and comprehensive condemnation of <i>all</i> marginal speculation. The
line of demarcation is usually carelessly drawn. If an individual buys
100 shares of stock for cash, has it registered in his own name and
later borrows funds from his banker with these shares as collateral, he
escapes impeachment as a marginal speculator; but if he buys on margin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and borrows from his broker the unpaid balance, he is a gambler. And
yet it would be hard to point out the difference in the two methods.
If we wish to go a little further afield, we may reduce a very large
percentage of the commercial structure to marginal trading. We may, in
short, place in this category every merchant who buys goods on credit
and every man who buys real estate on payments, if their object when
buying is to sell at a profit.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that these contentions will be vigorously
attacked, on the theory that more evil than good results from
speculative ventures, and that therefore the whole structure should
be razed on a “greatest good to the greatest number” basis; but aside
from the intensely unphilosophical character of this view, it is not
at all probable that any such thing can be effected unless human
nature undergoes a radical change. Tear down every stock exchange in
the United States tomorrow, and people will be speculating, a majority
of them foolishly, in another week. The cure lies not in paternalism,
but in evolution and understanding. As has been said, more has been
accomplished in recent years by the educational crusade of the press
than by all the rantings and warnings of a century. We have our periods
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of reckless over-indulgence, it is true, but the evil is dwindling. The
South Sea bubble would deceive a much smaller number of people today
than it did in the days of John Law.</p>

<p>It is the object of the present work to point out, so far as the
abilities of the writer will permit, what essentials are required in
any form of speculation, whether on margins, or masquerading in the
guise of investment. As to this last distinction, it may be stated that
the word “speculation” is herein taken to mean the purchase of any
security or commodity because it is considered cheap, with the ultimate
intention of disposing of the property so purchased at a profit. In the
writer’s opinion this definition is correct. Speculation contemplates
a rise in price, and an accretion in principal. Investment refers to
interest returns on money.</p>

<p>One of the most flagrant errors in speculation is an entirely mistaken
idea as to the <i>possibilities</i> in this field. Nine men out of ten
have a deep-rooted conviction that if any individual could be right in
his main deductions for, say one or two years, he should make millions
on a small capital. This is a great mistake, and leads to numerous
minor errors which are productive of much loss in actual operations.
The business of speculation never did, and never will result in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
abnormal profits. Large returns are sometimes made, it is true, but
this fact is also true of every other line of business. Certain
individuals grow very rich in Wall Street; this again is true of every
commercial branch. We hear now and then of a million dollar coup by
a Morgan or a Rockefeller, and do not stop to consider the great
capital behind it. If an individual makes five thousand dollars in a
year’s speculative ventures on a capital of twenty thousand, he is not
considered a Napoleon of finance, but he has accomplished much more, in
proportion to his capital, than Rockefeller would have accomplished if
he had made five millions on similar operations.</p>

<p>In a recent conversation with a number of gentlemen who clung
tenaciously to this idea of sudden riches, the writer undertook to
establish his contention. Tapes were secured recording the fluctuations
of sugar stock during a twenty point decline. The skeptics were given a
hypothetical capital of $10,000 each, subjected to the ordinary rules
of trading as to margins, etc., informed that sugar would decline
twenty points before it again touched the first quotation established,
and invited to “get rich quick.” The result was ridiculous in the
extreme. Two of the experimenters lost their imaginary capital trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
to double up and show large returns. The third took an unfair stand,
by selling the maximum amount at the inception of the experiment and
closing it after the 20 point decline had appeared. His operations,
therefore, proved nothing. Here was a case where two traders, possessed
of an absolute fore-knowledge of what was to occur, lost everything
through the fault of over-speculation and the belief that abnormal
returns could be made if the ultimate fate of a market could be
correctly forecasted. Even if we assume that <i>every</i> intermediate
<i>movement</i> were known in advance, that after a ten point decline
there would be a five point advance, and that transactions were
conducted to the full possibilities of both original margin and accrued
profits, the result would not be the millions which dazzle the eyes and
imagination of the unsophisticated. But to assume any such trading is
foolish. The factor of safety would be wholly absent. No wise man will
ever attempt pyramiding, and no foolish man who does, will succeed.</p>

<p>In order to clear the ground for discussion or study, the first thing
to eliminate is this wholly unsupported and mistaken idea of sudden
riches. No matter how correct the forecast of the future may be, safety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
disappears in inverse ratio to the increased possibilities of abnormal
returns; and with the factor of safety continually ignored, the final
results are bound to be disastrous.</p>

<p>It will also be necessary to dispel another illusion. If the speculator
imagines that he can operate successfully without preliminary hard
work to fit him for the business in hand he is grossly mistaken. It is
necessary to qualify in this field as well as in any other. Knowledge
of monetary conditions, values, interest rates, and in fact, of all
influences bearing directly or indirectly on the future of prices must
be acquired and thoroughly understood. Ignorance on any one point may
mean defeat. On the other hand, a study of such conditions means a
liberal education, valuable in every line of business life. It may be
further stated that the man who attempts to evade necessary labor and
research by placing his dependence on tips or charts, or the opinions
of others, cannot hope to succeed. The gambling idea must be put out of
the question entirely, and means sought whereby intelligent opinions
may be formed by both inductive and deductive reasoning.</p>

<p>In preparing this work the temptation to enter more extensively into
fundamental principles has been great. It would be impossible to do more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
than suggest a line of procedure in a single volume, and only the most
elemental requisites are set forth. And not only do the prescribed
limits of this volume forbid any exhaustive discussion, but such
discussion is unnecessary. On every subject of importance we have books
written by men of soberness and judgment, each a specialist in his
field. A bibliography has been appended to this volume suggesting such
works as are considered helpful. In this bibliography an attempt has
been made to choose such books as are clear and simple, rather than
those which are profound.</p>

<p>If the task as herein outlined, appears formidable, it may be said
that it is absolutely necessary, and not so difficult as may appear.
Before the student has entered far into the subject, he will find the
matter interesting and will very quickly realize that the well grounded
contentions and discussions of men who examine and diagnose economical
questions correctly, are of more value than the combined tips, guesses
and poorly based opinions of all the professional speculators and
gamblers from one end of Wall Street to the other. This form of basic
knowledge is just as important to the active trader as it is to the
investor. If he can correctly judge of the general trend of future
prices, he may operate safely <i>with</i> that trend instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
floundering around helplessly in a slough of indecision, or possibly
working directly against the current. If, for example, he has good
solid reasons for expecting ultimately higher prices, he will not be
disturbed by temporary reactions and, instead of being frightened out
of his position through ignorance, he will take advantage of such
reactions to make his purchases or cheapen his holdings. Knowledge, in
this particular line as in all others, is the foundation of successful ventures.

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br>The Cycles of Speculation</h2>
</div>

<p>The great upward and downward swings of speculative prices, herein
referred to as cycles, have invariably preceded or accompanied
periods of business inflation or depression. This fact, apparently so
elemental, is often disregarded by that very large class of speculators
which is continually looking for artificial and unpregnant explanations
of price changes. There can be no doubt as to the existence of
manipulation, and, in rare cases, movements of considerable importance
may be traced to this source alone; but manipulation consists, in
its fullest sense, of the tactics resorted to for the purpose of
liquidating shares in anticipation of a decline which the long-distance
thinkers believe to be inevitable; or, per contra, for the accumulation
of shares prior to a great recovery or readjustment. It is seldom
employed as a positive means of enhancing or depressing values. In
fact, to do either by mere manipulation would be an impossibility.
Every observer of great speculative movements knows that at the highest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
point of a movement, and during the first half of a decline everything
appears roseate, while at the lowest prices, and during the first half
of an advance, the reverse is true.</p>

<p>There are several contributory causes which operate to produce these
false appearances. The primary cause is the curtailed perspective
and imperfect logic of the public investor or speculator. The most
difficult thing to drill into the mind of the unsophisticated is
the fact that speculation cannot possibly be successfully based on
appearances which are open and obvious. Such a process is a flat
contradiction of the word itself. It is unseen future developments
or, in some cases, hidden and submerged present truths which must be
consulted. Yet we find a great majority of the public element who
seek riches in the speculative arena, constantly harping on the large
business of certain corporations, and the excellent state of general
trade as a reason for purchasing shares. These factors have, in all
probability, been discounted in current prices. Generally speaking, the
present is of no more use than the past in forming opinions of future
price changes. It is a certainty that sales of stocks could not be made
in great volume to good advantage unless everything <i>did</i> look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
rosy, for who would purchase shares at high prices if the future
appeared threatening or unpropitious, and who would sell holdings in
the face of encouraging and inspiriting prospects.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second phase of the question—the <i>creation</i>
of false appearances, which is, in truth, the highest form of
manipulation. When so-called inside selling is going on, great business
is reported by railroad and producing corporations; dividends are
increased, and public expressions of confidence emanate from men of
high standing in the financial world. The effect of all this expressed
optimism is, market-wise, of a negative character. When it is most
prevalent and most decisive, prices halt or even decline. This period
and action represents selling at the only time when advantageous
selling is possible. In the main the truth only is told about existent
conditions, possibly about the near future. Nothing else is necessary;
but nevertheless the sellers are anticipating, not the events of the
next week or the next month, but of a more remote period where they see
probabilities in regard to which a discreet silence is maintained.</p>

<p>The constantly recurring cycles of prices, the alternate inflation and
depression, must therefore be traced to something far more important
than the grossly exaggerated potentiality of mere manipulation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<h3>Principal Crises of the Last Century.</h3>

<p>That crises in the financial world have occurred at more or less
regular periods is a matter of history. Since the beginning of the
nineteenth century ten of these readjustments have occurred. In 1812,
after ten years of prosperous conditions preceding the war of that
year, business fell off materially. The real panic, however, occurred
in 1814. Washington was taken by the British on August 24th, 1814, and
suspension of specie payments was general in the following two weeks.</p>

<p>In 1824, the protective tariff enactments were followed by general
inflation in all lines of business. Two years later, in 1826, a general
depression occurred with many failures. The depression at this period
was even greater in England than in the United States, and many writers
attribute the entire trouble to European business reverses, but it is
probable that we had been living beyond our means and that this fact,
to say the least, aggravated the disturbance.</p>

<p>In 1837, after six years of good times, another crisis occurred. This
depression was attributed to various causes. The great New York fire of
1835, the loss of charter by the United States Bank in 1836, and the
calling in of $37,500,000 of government deposits by President Jackson,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
are all given due consideration. The actual panic, however, did not
appear until May 10, 1837. All the banks suspended specie payments, and
securities,—in fact all properties of whatever kind—fell rapidly in
value. The most plausible explanation of this crisis is over-speculation
in land. The other evils mentioned might easily have been rectified
by the recuperative powers of a growing country, had the more serious
element of wild inflation been absent.</p>

<p>In 1848, after a long period of prosperity, broken only by the war with
Mexico, business inflation and over-speculation again brought about the
logical and inevitable result. Europe also had been over-speculating
again and a crisis in England soon extended to the United States.
Liquidation was drastic and the depression lasted until the discovery
of gold in California began to bear fruit.</p>

<p>In 1857, one of the most serious, as well as the most short-lived, of
our crises occurred. Again speculation was extreme; December, 1856,
marked the high point in securities, and prices continued to sag for
some months; but it was not until August, 1857, that a panic occurred.</p>

<p>In 1864, came a crash in speculative prices following tremendous
inflation. Between April, 1864, and April, 1865, leading stocks declined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
from $50 to $100 per share. As the inflation of this period was caused
largely by the high prices of commodities and greatly increased
railroad earnings occasioned by the events of the Civil War, most
writers on the subject do not consider it in their theoretical
discussions of crises.</p>

<p>In 1872, another boom was on, particularly in Iron and Steel. The
Chicago and Boston fires had not been as effective in breaking stock
prices as might have been expected. Prices of stocks began going down
materially in April, 1873, and in fact had been rather “toppy” during
the preceding years. This panic, like most of the others, was preceded
by enormous speculation and high prices. It is interesting to note that
while stocks were declining, general business was booming. The trained
minds of Wall Street were learning to discount the future at longer
range and more accurately. The iron and steel business exceeded all
former records in 1873, both in the matter of normal price and actual
production.</p>

<p>In January, 1884, numerous failures and suspensions produced a panic
which was in reality the culmination of a long decline. As in 1872,
this panic was preceded by enormous general business. The steel and
iron trade again broke all records in 1882, and other lines were
equally prosperous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>In 1893, the period of prosperity which followed the enactment of the
McKinley bill was rudely broken. Speculation had been rampant, as
usual. On May 4th, 1893, the National Cordage Company went into the
hands of a receiver. Only a year prior to that date, this corporation
was paying 12% in dividends and the stock was selling well above
par. There were many badly inflated stocks and many rotten spots in
the speculative stock markets. The Distillers and Cattle Feeders
shares fell from $70 to nothing, and were assessed $20 per share.
The aggregate liabilities of business failures in 1893 were almost
$350,000,000, over 20% greater than in 1892. Banks failed right and
left, and several leading railroad companies went into the hands of
receivers.</p>

<p>In 1903, another period of depression occurred. It is doubtful if this
period can be rightly classed with the other crises already mentioned,
for it was more in the nature of a drastic but orderly retrenchment
than a panic, and the bull stock market of 1902 was again in full swing
early in 1904.</p>

<p>In thus briefly detailing the crucial points of nineteenth century
financial affairs, there is no intention of entering an economic
discussion, and no pretence of giving anything like a comprehensive
history of the events preceding or following their recurrence. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
subject here discussed is speculation, and the object sought is to
gain knowledge that may be of value in forming opinions as to future
prices. We may gain some information of this character by analyzing the
following points:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1—Did price declines in stocks precede, accompany, or follow</li>
<li class="isub4">panics, crises, or general business depression?</li>
<li class="isub2">2—What are the signs which usually precede such periods?</li>
<li class="isub2">3—What are the salient causes?</li>
<li class="isub2">4—Can any dependence be placed in the regularity</li>
<li class="isub4">of these recurrences?</li>
</ul>

<p>On the first head it will be found that in all cases the top of the
stock market has been reached prior to the actual eruption in general
business. Stock speculation in 1814 and 1826 was not of great volume
nor importance, and cannot be given much consideration.</p>

<p>Beginning with the panic of 1837 we find that the highest prices for
stocks were made in October, 1836, while panic conditions did not occur
until May, 1837. Preceding the panic of August, 1857, highest prices
were reached in the last months of 1856. Highest figures were recorded
in April, 1872, just one year prior to the panic of 1873. The stock
market anticipated the troubles of 1884 by 17 months of declining
prices. In January, 1892, stocks began declining and continued their
downward course until the panic of 1893 cleared the atmosphere. In our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
last period of depression (1903) stocks had reached their pinnacle in
September, 1902, just one year before the market turned for the better.</p>

<p>We find therefore that in the majority of instances, highest prices for
stocks were reached long before business troubles were openly apparent.
This action represents to a certain extent the selling of stocks by men
who were wise enough to foresee trouble.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact in regard to crises is that they are usually
preceded by record-breaking business in all directions. As iron and
steel may be considered the best barometer of business conditions, the
following tables are instructive:</p>

<p>It will be observed that the high record of production has been reached
just prior to our greatest periods of depression, or during such periods.</p>

<p>The second phase of the question, “what signs usually precede such
periods?” opens a wide field for the student of speculative changes.
Some inspiration may be gained from an examination of the two points
already considered, i.e.: priority of price movements and business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
inflation; but it would be extremely difficult to use them as guides
unless many other factors were given consideration. If we eliminate
the element of periodicity, any attempt to determine the turning point
by examination of advances in prices of stocks or volume of production
and consumption of commodities is futile. Using pig iron as a barometer
we might, after production has gradually increased from 8,623,127 tons
in 1896, to 15,878,354 in 1901, argue that a considerable reaction was
due in this line, but we would be out in our calculations two years and
two million tons. Neither can we accept the simple fact of a decline,
or the beginning of a decline in iron or in any other single commodity
as indicating lower prices for stocks; for however accurate iron may
be as a barometer of general business, it is not at all a barometer
of the stock market. It is practically certain that stock prices will
move either to higher or lower prices long before any reasons for such
movements are apparent to the ordinary observer. Future stock market
movements are largely deductive, and are not founded upon ordinary
industrial statistical evidence.</p>

<p>There is, however, one method by which some light may be thrown
upon the subject of probable movements. A careful study of monetary
conditions and expansion of credits will frequently reveal dangers not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
apparent in any other direction. It is scarcely necessary to say that
such examination must not be confined to one quarter, such as New York
City; or to one country, such as the United States. A comprehensive
view of the world’s monetary conditions will be necessary. This subject
is dealt with more fully in another chapter.</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion among writers and students of
economics as to the cause of depressions. Bagehot attributes it to
the fact that, “at particular times a great many stupid people have a
great deal of stupid money.” This writer contends that occasionally
money accumulates abnormally and craves an investment outlet. To use
his own words, “This blind capital seeks for some one to devour it,
and there is plethora; it finds some one, and there is speculation; it
is devoured, and there is a panic.” Horace White attributes panics to
over-speculation. Bonamy Price says: “A vast outlay in new enterprises
involving a large consumption of food and materials, whether in the way
of pure waste or temporary unproductiveness, ought always to suggest a
feeling of danger. This excess occurs in seasons of prosperity.” John
B. Clark holds that it is due to an excess of production; or an excess
of production in one line with a deficiency in others. Leone Levi: “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
main cause for the occurrence of crises is the sudden realization of
an insufficiency of capital to meet present demands.” Thorold Rogers
says: “The cause exists in the function of exchange; in the expectation
of unreasonable profits and in incorrect calculation.” It was the late
Henry George’s theory that depressions are brought about by higher
prices of land. He held that workers thrive as they have easy access
to natural opportunities for production, and are impoverished as
they are deprived of such opportunities. All periods of speculation
and inflation end in higher land values. Landlords call for a larger
percentage of the product than workers can afford to pay, and both
labor and capital become idle until there is a readjustment. Prof. W.
S. Jevons, and a host of others, attribute crises to sun spots and
their effects on harvests. And so on through a long line of theories.</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion appears to favor the theory of
over-speculation, whether in realty, commodities, or the shares of
corporations, and this leads up to the question of periodicity. That
there has been a recurrence of these troubles about once in ten years
is not a debatable question. Nevertheless, many thinkers scout the idea
of this repetition at marked periods being other than fortuitous. As
prominent a student as Thorold Rogers, for example, ridicules the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
theory of periodicity. Many hopeful people believe that in time we will
find means to avoid these bad spots; that the United States is a young
and enthusiastic country, and that we will gradually sober down in both
methods and effects. But against this theory lies the cold fact that
these cycles have occurred with as charming regularity in France and
England as they have in our own country, which would indicate that age
and seasoning does not produce any appreciable improvement.</p>

<p>It is probable that the most acceptable theory as to the causes of
periodicity is the psychological contention. Human nature is much the
same throughout the civilized world. We suffer from a panic and a
period of depression, and we grow wary and conservative. This course
results in sound methods and accumulation. The business structure rests
on a firmer foundation. Gradually the hard lessons of the past are
forgotten by the older generation, and are entirely unlearned by the
new business generation, all of whom are optimists. Again we expand
our enterprises, again fortune favors us; the appetite for gold grows
greater as wealth accumulates; men who were economical and satisfied
on modest incomes now live extravagantly, and some of them dream of
millions. Capital is spread out thinly. Story after story is erected on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
one foundation, and that foundation, sound enough at first, eventually
gives way. Then we must begin our careful building once more. The ten
year periods, therefore, may represent with more or less accuracy,
the lapse of time between wisdom and folly,—the yard-stick of human
intellect and experience.</p>

<p>Many of the writers on this subject seem to strive for tangible reasons
for each depression. They dive into the subject for a cause and emerge
with an effect, or a handful of effects. For example, the depression
following 1893 was not caused by the failures of banks and other
business institutions, but the failures were caused by the depression.
It matters not that the failures ante-dated the bad conditions. Again,
the depression itself was produced by prior inflation. It was the
illness after over-stimulation. And so, in turn, we can ask what caused
the inflation; and the answer is “Human greed and human folly.” This
last analysis brings us around in a circle to the original theory of a
psychological cause.</p>

<p>It is submitted that a dependence on periodicity of any kind, either in
the ten year cycles or in year to year events is fraught with danger
and cannot be adopted by the speculator. It is chart-playing pure and
simple, and the man who disposes of his stocks for no better reason than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
that a depression appeared ten years ago, is liable to find himself
in the position of the chart-enthusiast, who, after tracing a marked
uniformity in movements for a period of years, runs into reverses and
loses all.</p>

<p>It is not meant to say that a knowledge of the past is without value.
Inductive reasoning is almost as important as deductive reasoning,
when properly employed and applied. If we scrutinize the history of
past crises and great movements with a view to determining the salient
causes therefor, a great deal has been gained, for we may apply this
knowledge to existent elements lying parallel to those which caused
trouble in the past, and thus decide what is probable in the future.
If, on the other hand, we place dependence on mere repetition, we gain
nothing in education and stand in constant danger.</p>

<p>It may be contended that the active speculator has little to do with
ten year cycles or their causes, but this is not the case. A correct
understanding of the reasons for the great cycles will simplify the
study of smaller intermediate movements. Much knowledge applicable
to year to year movements will be gained. Monetary troubles, for
example, occur almost annually, and their effects on market movements
are usually, (not always), similar to those of more widely separated
periods, but, of course, in a lesser degree.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br>The Gold Supply</h2>
</div>

<p>It may be stated without hesitation that the effect of the increasing
supply of gold upon prices of all bonds, shares, or commodities which
may be classed as speculative, is more decided and certain in its
operation than any other single factor. The process of readjustment due
to this cause would be slow and regular if the principles at issue were
universally and clearly understood. Not being generally recognized,
however, the changes wrought by what is naturally an insidious factor
are, at times, spasmodic and feverish. It is a remarkable fact that
whenever a revolution occurs in any economic or financial process
which is, by its nature, concealed or recondite, its existence and
influence are discovered by a number of students simultaneously but
independently. Important reversions or modifications may be submerged
for a long period, and suddenly light is offered from all parts of
the thinking world. It is probable that this intellectual phenomenon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
extends to, or is communicated to the financial world, and that marked
and drastic changes in the affected quarters represent a belated
recognition of forces hitherto unknown, and the readjustment of
affairs by those who see first and furthest. That the operations of
this minority will be important goes without saying. The faculty to
grasp fully and quickly anything salient bearing on financial affairs
is the ground-work of riches and consequently the trained minds of
great holders of shares or commodities will respond most readily to
sound basic arguments, and the greatest holders can often make of
their knowledge a two-edged sword. For example, certain large holders
of bonds, recognizing the fact that increasing gold production means
higher interest rates, and consequently lower prices for bonds, would
be able to dispose of bonds to advantage because of the apparent
general prosperity growing out of this same production of gold. It may
be assumed that in pointing out in interviews, etc., this reign of
prosperity, the gentlemen in question would modestly omit to mention
that the same influences which were causing high prices and much
business in some quarters, were working damage in others.</p>

<p>Something of this kind has been going on in our bond and stock markets
of late. The inevitable influence of gold on prices has made itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
slowly felt for a long period, but it is only in the last year that a
considerable number of individuals whose operations are of importance
in the financial world have come to recognize how powerful this
influence is. Price changes in divers securities and commodities
hitherto unaccounted for, or attributed to wrong influences, have
suddenly been explained to a number of important financiers, and a
correct understanding of the problem has undoubtedly resulted in
radical readjustments in some quarters. With that pertinacity in error
which seems to distinguish the ordinary speculator, he has, however,
gone on attributing these processes of equilibration to causes which
have only a limited bearing on the case. The recent heavy decline in
bonds and stocks, for example, was popularly ascribed to political
and legislative action against railroads. Scarcity of money was given
second place in these deductions, and gold production third place, or
no place at all. If we reverse this order of importance and give gold
production first place, monetary affairs second place, and political
affairs third place, we are nearer the truth. It looks a little
ridiculous that the scope of intelligent perspective should be blocked
by three thousand miles of water, and that the unthinking majority who
ascribe our decline in bonds to local politics should have failed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
recognize so potent a fact as that the decline was world-wide; but
such is the case. The readjustment in bonds was due to excessive
over-production of gold, and it may be safely assumed that so long as
this over-production continues to increase rapidly, bonds will continue
low in price or, what amounts to the same thing, interest rates will
remain high.</p>

<p>As to the importance of a correct understanding on this subject of gold
supply and its influence on prices, I quote from Mr. Byron W. Holt’s
book “The Gold Supply and Prosperity,” which, I may add, is used as the
text book for this chapter. Mr. Holt says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“This is the great problem that now confronts the
financial world and demands solution of every investor. Not to solve
it may mean great loss and possible failure. To solve it means success
and greatly enhanced wealth for all who now have either a fair share of
this world’s goods or who have credit and can intelligently go in debt
for a large amount.”</p>

<p>As speculation or investment-speculation, as defined in the
introduction to this book, are the subjects under discussion it is the
intention to take up, in turn, such points as bear particularly upon
price changes of speculative shares and commodities influenced by our
increasing supply of gold. The main points to be considered are as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1—The effect upon bonds and preferred stocks having a fixed</li>
<li class="isub4">rate of income.</li>
<li class="isub2">2—The effect upon common stocks of railroad corporations.</li>
<li class="isub2">3—The effect upon stocks of industrial corporations.</li>
<li class="isub2">4—The effect upon speculative commodities—wheat, corn,</li>
<li class="isub4">oats, cotton, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of argument it will be assumed in this discussion that
our supply of gold is rapidly increasing. We know that such has been
the case in recent years, and it is the opinion of most students that
this increase may be confidently expected to continue. To quote again
from the work already mentioned:</p>

<p>“Both the output and supply of gold are likely to increase for many
years.</p>

<p>“While the future output of gold is, of necessity, unknown and
uncertain, there is great unanimity of opinion, among mining experts,
on this point. It appears to be generally recognized that, during the
last twenty years, the industry of gold mining, or rather of gold
production, has been established on a very different and much more
certain basis than any previously existing. No longer is the output
of gold dependent mainly, or even largely, upon placer mining and the
chance finds of ‘free’ gold. The supply of gold, in rock, sand, clay,
and water, being inexhaustible, it is now possible, by machinery and
metallurgical processes, to extract gold, in paying quantities, from
many forms of these vast store-houses. To such an extent is this true
that the future supply of gold is even more secure than is that of
coal, iron, lumber, wheat or cotton.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Even if prospecting were to stop and attention were to be devoted
only to the gold mines and bodies already discovered, and geologically
in sight, it is probable that the output of gold would continue to
increase for many years. As Mr. Selwyn-Brown, a gold mining expert,
tells us in his very interesting article, ‘as the rich surface deposits
are being worked out, improvements in mining and metallurgical
processes are enabling poorer and poorer deposits to be worked.’ That
is, improvements in ‘stamp mills,’ cyanide mills, dredging machines and
other gold extracting apparatus and processes are being made so rapidly
that it is, every year, becoming profitable to work lower and lower
grades of ore, sand and earth. As the grade declines the quantity in
sight increases rapidly. In fact there are almost literally mountains
of low grade gold ore that can even now be worked profitably. Some of
the largest, most productive and most profitable mines of today contain
ore averaging less than $3 and, in some instances, only $2 of gold per ton.</p>

<p>“The supply of such ore being inexhaustible the output depends upon
the number and size of the mills employed to extract the gold. It is
reasonably certain that, for years to come, the improvements in methods
and processes of mining will more than keep pace with both the decline
in the quality of the ore and the increase in the cost of mining due to
rising prices and wages, occasioned by the depreciation of gold.</p>

<p>“In view of all the facts, Mr. Selwyn-Brown’s conclusion that ‘a
progressive increase each year may confidently be expected’ is
conservative. This conclusion, is almost a certainty. The uncertainty
lies in the possibility, if not probability, either of discovering
many important new mines in the practically unexplored parts of every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
continent, or of making improvements that will radically reduce the
cost of extracting gold. In either case the increase in the output of
gold might be not simply arithmetically but geometrically progressive.”</p>

<p>Admitting that the question of gold production is debatable, it remains
for the future to develop any radical change, and it will be necessary
for the student to decide this point for himself either by the light
of facts as yet not established, or by accepting theories as yet
not convincingly erected. If a change occurs, or may reasonably be
expected, an understanding of the subject from the positive side of
the question loses none of its value. The principles involved could be
as successfully applied in reading the probable future by modifying or
reversing effects, and reconciling them to a modification or reversal
in the cause. If, for example, we accept the theory that increased gold
production means advancing commodity prices, and find reason later
to believe that gold production will cease to maintain its ratio of
increase, we may alter our views accordingly so far as this single
influence is concerned.</p>

<h3><i>1—The effect of the increasing gold production on bonds<br>
 and preferred stocks having a fixed rate of income.</i></h3>

<p>In this division of the question the crux of the whole matter is
interest on money. The question might, in fact, be stated thus: “What is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the effect of increasing gold supply on money interest rates?” and
having solved that problem, the original inquiry is answered.</p>

<p>To reach a reasonable solution we must first examine the effect of an
unduly increasing supply of gold on commodity prices. Over-production
in any quarter inevitably leads to lower prices. Gold being a fixed
standard cannot decline in figures, but it does so in fact. That is to
say, the flexible prices of things which gold will buy rise to fill
the gap. Thus, since 1896, prices of commodities have risen 50%. The
man who loaned money ten years ago finds its purchasing power impaired
33⅓%, when it is returned to him today, for the reason that commodity
prices having advanced 50% in the interim, his dollar will now buy only
66⅔% of what it would buy in 1897. This impairment of principal will
be covered, in part at least, by interest rates. This effect, if not
recognized and arbitrary would adjust itself automatically, regardless
of whether or not investors recognize the influence of changing values
of gold, for money, finding higher returns in other quarters, would
speedily desert the long-term, fixed-interest investment field, and
prices of such securities would decline through lack of demand.</p>

<p>On the subject of interest rates Mr. Holt says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">“But there is another reason why interest rates
should be high when prices are rising. When money is shrinking in value
interest rates should be high to make up, or partly make up, the losses
on the principals of loans. To illustrate: Suppose that prices are
rising 10% a year. This means that the purchasing power of money is
declining about 10% a year. Suppose, then, that $100 were loaned for
one year at 5%. At the end of the year the lender would have $105; but
with this $105 he could buy only about as much as he could have bought
with $95, at the beginning of the year. In reality, he has received no
interest at all but has, instead, paid $5 to the man for holding his
$100. The man with money to loan cannot afford to do business in this
way. He is usually as wise as are his neighbors, and fully as able to
protect his own interests and to get all his money is worth, either by
buying real property, investing in bonds and stock or by loaning on
notes or on call.”</p>

<p>In submitting the above contentions it must be fairly stated that
there is some diversity of opinion as to the effects of gold on
interest rates. A few writers demur to the theory; others hold that
the effect is nil, and one or two openly adopt the negative side
of the discussion, and state that more money means lower rates of
interest. The majority of recent investigators, however, appear to be
accepting the theory as given herein, and it may be added that prices
of the class of securities considered have borne out the hypothesis
faithfully, and that the minority have failed to offer convincing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
explanations of this readjustment. It will not do to point to the
fact that money has been fully employed in constructive rather than
investment fields of late; for while this is true enough, it does not
explain why gilt-edged bonds such as British Consols have declined
in value, while stocks and shares which did not bear the onus of
circumscribed returns have advanced. There are, of course, contributory
causes: the Labor-Socialistic Government in England no doubt affects
the prices of consols, but this influence is specific, and loses
most of its force when we consider that not only these particular
securities, but practically all others of their class the world over
have suffered a radical decline. In other words, interest rates have
grown comprehensively higher. The theory appears sound, is borne out
by events, and mere denial does not weaken it. It may well be accepted
until its opponents succeed in giving us something more convincing in
its place.</p>

<p>In support of the theory, Mr. Holt reproduces the following table of
British bonds from Moody’s Magazine for October, 1906.

<p class="blockquot">“Thus,” comments the writer, “these 13 British
bonds, supposedly the safest and least speculative of all securities,
have declined an average of over 28 points in ten years. Considering
incomes and present prices, the unfortunate investors in these bonds
have not only received less than 1% on their investments, during the
last ten years, but, should they sell their bonds, they would find that
the proceeds have lost 30% of the purchasing power of a similar amount
ten years ago. Altogether, they have suffered a net loss, over incomes,
of more than 20%, or over 2% a year.”</p>

<p>There are other economic influences affecting interest rates through
gold supply, but the one given appears to the writer the most direct
and forcible when applied to readjustment of prices to income.</p>

<p>In weighing the influence of increasing gold production and its effect
upon interest rates through the advancing prices of commodities, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
student is liable to fall into one grave error. He may perhaps jump

to the conclusion that gradually advancing prices of commodities
mean gradually advancing rates of interest. This is not at all the
case. A sustained ratio of advance means sustained high rates of
interest—nothing more. In order to make this clear let us go back to
the original principle.</p>

<p>Increasing prices for commodities mean an impairment of the purchasing
power of money. If the purchasing power of money is impaired 2% per
annum through increasing prices of commodities, and the normal rate
of interest is 4%, we can cover the deficiency by making the interest
rate 6% <i>and leaving it there as long as this ratio of impairment
is maintained</i>. In other words the man who loans $1,000 at 6%
loses $20.00 per annum in the impairment of capital and receives
normal interest of $40.00 per annum and $20 extra to cover his loss in
capital. Strictly speaking the extra 2% is not interest at all, but an
amortization payment. It matters not how high prices ultimately go, he
receives each year a bonus sufficient to cover his loss in capital, and
the interest rate remains 6%.</p>

<p>Therefore, if prices of commodities advanced for ten years and then
ceased to advance, but were maintained at the highest figures reached,
interest rates would fall because there would be no further impairment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
of capital, and what was formerly amortization, would become usury. On
the other hand, if a new ratio of increase should occur in commodity
prices and they should advance 4% per annum, interest rates would, if
fully adjusted, reach 8%-4% for normal interest, and 4% for impairment
of capital.</p>

<h3><i>2—The effect upon Common Stocks<br>of Railroad Corporations.</i></h3>

<p>Here the effect of high interest rates is, or in time may be, offset
by returns in the form of dividends, undivided profits, improvement of
property, or the fact that income is not limited. But there is another
trouble, and a serious one, for which the gold supply is responsible.</p>

<p>If the increasing supply of gold is responsible for higher commodity
prices it must be at once apparent that the building, equipment
and maintenance of railway properties costs more and more as all
commodities, including labor, advance in price. This would be all
right if the selling commodity, i. e.: transportation, also advanced
proportionately in price; but it is so difficult to override popular
prejudice and widespread misunderstanding on this point, that we find
continued agitation and legislation not only against advancing rates,
but with a view to reducing those which already obtain. There must, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
course, be a limit to this thing, and if the cost of production
continues to increase, the railroads must be permitted to demand
higher prices for transportation. Otherwise a point would finally
be reached where every railroad in the country would be forced into
bankruptcy. The great danger lies in a belated assimilation of
this truth by the masses, and too much demagoguery on the part of
politicians who do understand, but, being politicians, prefer to
reflect the views of a majority of constituents, rather than to enter
a campaign of proselyting. That evils have been fostered and wrongs
committed by eminent railroad financiers is certain; but there is
considerable confusion of ideas on this head. Over-capitalization,
illegal combinations, manipulation of funds for private gain, and the
swelling of dividends for stock-jobbing purposes, when the funds so
distributed should have gone into improvements or surplus, have all
played their part in arousing the wrath and indignation of the great
majority, and they are, as a class, prone to jump to the conclusion
that any and every railroad corporation is charging unduly high rates
for its services, and making exorbitant returns on invested capital.
This has, no doubt, been more or less true in the past in certain cases
where extremely high rates were made, and the apparent returns on money
attenuated by over-capitalization; but this evil is gradually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
decreasing, and the real fight is, or should be, against these abuses.
The railroads are suffering for the sins of the past, and may suffer
still further; but the time is not far distant when, unless conditions
change radically, the railroads must be allowed more latitude in the
adjustment of rates.</p>

<p>The prevalent opinion, that needed reforms which strike at the root
of the evils mentioned above is a bear argument, is another popular
fallacy. Such reforms intelligently conceived, and unswervingly carried
out, are all in favor of the small shareholder. If laws can be enacted
which will prevent individual interests from plundering or misusing
the funds of corporations, and which will compel these corporations to
issue reports and statements which are not so involved and complex as
to be beyond the ordinary comprehension, the small holder or investor
will have a better show. But, having cured these evils, no laws can
possibly endure which contemplate curtailing fair returns on money, and
fair profits through natural enhancement in values.</p>

<p>But, however fair or cheering this view may appear, the fact remains
that it will be slow in its acceptance and slower in its operation. We
may therefore summarize the situation thus. Increasing production of
gold brings about increasing cost of operation, and so long as cost of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
operation is advanced with no corresponding advance in selling price of
transportation, the ratio of profits will gradually decrease until a
vanishing point is reached.</p>

<p>In the last analysis, a probable tardy and reluctant recognition of the
true status of the case warrants the belief that for the near future,
the railroads have a hard time ahead of them, and that so far as this
single important influence is concerned, it is decidedly a bearish factor.</p>

<h3><i>3—The effect upon stocks of<br> industrial corporations.</i></h3>

<p>Here we have a different proposition. Rising prices for commodities
do not interfere with the earning power of corporations which produce
and sell commodities, the prices of which are not limited by law. In
fact these corporations are, in many cases, gainers by this influence
which tends to advance prices, not only of what they buy, but of what
they sell. It may be added, parenthetically, that railroad companies
which own valuable coal lands, etc., find the bad influences already
discussed partially offset by the gain from such holdings. The railroad
company, however, may be considered as pre-eminently a seller of
transportation and has been so regarded herein.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The industrial corporations whose products are subject to regulation
by law, such as gas and electric lighting companies, are subject to
practically the same influences as those which operate against the
prices of railroad stocks. Their cost of production advances easily
and inevitably, and the selling price remains fixed, or advances with
difficulty and under protest.</p>

<h3><i>4—The effect on speculative commodities—<br>Wheat, Corn, Oats,
Cotton, etc.</i></h3>

<p>This phase of the subject will be dismissed with a few words. If the
contentions already made are accepted, it is apparent that all such
commodities will gradually seek a higher level. A brief examination
of statistics will show that this readjustment has been going on for
years. The gradually ascending pivotal point, or average price, is
particularly marked in the cheaper cereals,—corn and oats, and also in
cotton. This is probably due to the fact that wages have not advanced
as rapidly as have prices of living. It is found that in periods of
hard times consumption of cheaper foodstuffs and textile fabrics
is increased, while the consumption of higher priced commodities
and luxuries are curtailed. The wage-earner, therefore, has been in
reality living in a regime of hard times, although this fact is easily
submerged by steadier employment, by a fictitious appearance of general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
prosperity, and the ability to spend a larger number of dollars,
without realizing fully the loss of purchasing power in the dollars.</p>

<p>It would be out of the question to attempt to enter anything like
a comprehensive study of the question of gold production and its
effects in a single chapter, or even in a single volume; neither is it
necessary to the purposes of this work, for the student who desires
a comprehensive education in this regard will find ample means and
material ready to his hand. From the standpoint of investment and
speculation alone, it is submitted that increasing production of gold
is, to use the phraseology of the street, bearish on long time bonds
and other securities yielding a limited rate of interest or income,
temporarily bearish on railroad stocks, bullish on industrial shares,
except as noted, and bullish on speculative commodities.</p>

<p>At the risk of indulging in undue reiteration, attention will again be
called to the fallacy of considering such subjects as the one of gold
production too remote in concrete effects, or too sluggish in operation
to be of importance to the speculator. A thorough understanding of
cause and effect bears upon the operations of today, in that it
anticipates the results of tomorrow. Through knowledge of influences of
this character, serious error may be avoided. For example, one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
profound axioms of the speculative world is that bonds advance first
and stocks afterwards. If we understand <i>why</i> bonds have been, and
are at present, declining we may be justified in modifying this view
and considering the axiom more or less obsolete. He who operates an
engine without a clear understanding of its motive power is likely to
get into trouble, or perhaps be blown up.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out also, that a too literal acceptance of the
suggested effects of this or any other great price influence is highly
dangerous. Even while gold production continues to increase rapidly,
prices, not only of shares, but of all things, will overleap themselves
and will also swing backwards to the other extreme. The cycles are
not completed, until both zenith and nadir have been touched. Changes
in gold production will not prevent declines in prices; they will,
however, interfere with the regularity of the cycles.</p>

<p>This chapter may be fittingly closed with the following list of
conclusions reached by Mr. Holt, in the work already mentioned. These
conclusions cover all the points herein presented, and others which are
of interest and value:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">“1—That both the output and supply of gold are
likely to increase rapidly for many years.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“2—That, therefore, the value of gold will
depreciate as the quantity increases.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“3—That this depreciation will be measured by the
rise in the average price level.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“4—That a rising price level, if long continued, is
accompanied by rising or high interest rates.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“5—That high interest rates mean lower prices for
bonds and all other long-time obligations drawing
fixed rates of interest, dividends, or income.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“6—Rising prices increase the cost of materials and
of operation and tend to decrease the net profits
of all concerns, the prices of whose products or
services either cannot be advanced at all, or are not
free to advance rapidly.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“7—Rising prices tend to increase the net profits of
all concerns that own their own sources of materials
and supplies.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“8—Rising prices of commodities tend to cause
the prices of all tangible property to rise. This
includes lands, mines, forests, buildings and
improvements.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“9—Rising prices of commodities and property tend to
increase the value of the securities of corporations
holding commodities or property.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“10—Rising prices and cost of living necessitate
higher money wages, though the rise of wages will
follow, at some distance, behind the rise of prices.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“11—As rising prices do not mean increased profits
to all concerns, many employers will not concede
higher wages without strikes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“12—Rising prices and wages, therefore, mean
dwindling profits and troublous times in many
industries, with complete ruin as the final goal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">“13—Because wages will not rise as fast or as
much as prices and the cost of living, there will be dissatisfaction
and unrest among wage and salary earners.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“14—Rising prices of commodities and property
encourage speculation in commodities, stocks and real estate and
discourage honest industry.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“15—Thus, rising prices, by diminishing the
incomes of ‘safe’ investments in ‘gilt-edged’ bonds and stocks and
by increasing the profits of speculators encourage extravagance,
recklessness and thriftlessness.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“16—As rising prices decrease the purchasing
power of debts, and thus aid debtors at the expense of creditors, they
discourage saving and thrift.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“17—Rising prices, then, by promoting speculation
and extravagance, increase consumption, especially of luxuries, and,
therefore, stimulate production.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“18—Rising prices, then, result in what is real
prosperity for many industries; but what is for a nation as a whole,
artificial or sham prosperity—the result of marking up prices rather
than of increasing production.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“19—With prices, wages, rates and industries
always imperfectly adjusted to the ever depreciating value of gold,
and with instability and uncertainty throughout the financial world,
there cannot but be a great shifting around of values and of titles to
property.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“20—As this shifting is to the advantage of the
debtors—the rich—and to the disadvantage of the creditors—the great
middle class—it results in rapidly concentrating wealth in the hands of
a comparatively few.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">“21—For all of these reasons a prolonged period
of rapidly rising prices is reasonably certain to become a period of
unrest, discontent, agitation, strikes, riots, rebellions and wars.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“22—A rapidly depreciating standard of value
then, if long continued, not only produces most important results in
the financial, industrial and commercial world, but is likely to result
in changes of great consequence in the political, social, and religious world.</p>
</div>

<p>“In view of all the facts, results and possible
consequences connected with the increasing output and supply of gold,
The Wall Street Journal was right when, on December 4, 1906, it said
that ‘No other economic force is at present in operation in the world
of more stupendous power than that of gold production.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>Money</h2>
</div>

<p>From the viewpoint of the speculator, money conditions require constant
consideration. It goes without saying that no sustained bull market is
possible unless money conditions favor such a movement. We find that
at the end of a period of inflation, the credit situation is always
strained, while a general recession in business will usually cure the
evil.</p>

<p>The student may enter this large and important branch of the subject
as deeply as he likes. There are many excellent works dealing with the
various phases of the subject, and the question has been so long and
carefully studied by writers, that many important points have been
established so definitely as to admit of little diversity of opinion.</p>

<p>The bank statement which is issued weekly by the New York Clearing
House, is eagerly scanned by traders, but it is not always the case
that this scrutiny is thorough or enlightening. The statement at its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
best, cannot be considered more than a barometer, and its showings are
by no means exact, as it is based on a system of daily averages. That
is to say, the banks figure their loans, deposits, etc., for each day
of the week, and report the averages to the Clearing House. This method
often leads to a false showing. Commenting on this fact, Mr. S. S.
Pratt in his book, “The Work of Wall Street,” says:</p>

<p>“A striking illustration of the effect of the law of averages upon
the Bank Statement was given in September, 1902. The statement of
September 20 reported a loss in cash of $7,300,000, while the actual
loss, so far as it could be estimated, was only $3,600,000. The
statement of September 27th, on the other hand, reported a gain in
cash of $1,790,000, while the apparent loss was $4,000,000. The former
statement reported a deficit in reserve; the latter a surplus.”</p>

<p>It is the practice of many speculators to examine the bank statement
merely as regards the changes made from week to week, without reference
to the more important totals. A decrease in reserves is considered an
evil, etc. There is something in this of course, but such methods and
deductions are incomplete and insufficient. A decrease in reserves when
the surplus is very large may be practically meaningless, while the
same amount of decrease when reserves are small may be significant. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
is a good deal like the difference between a man spending a dollar when
he has a hundred, and spending his last dollar.</p>

<p>The most important general information to be gained from the bank
statement, is by a comparison of loans with deposits, and specie with
loans. We may thus arrive at a fairly correct idea of the state of
trade and the expansion of credits. If we find that loans are in excess
of deposits, and the percentage of specie small, we may, with certain
qualifications, deduce inflation; while on the other hand, the extent
of liquidation may be judged in case these conditions are reversed. As
an example of this process, the following historical facts are given.</p>

<p>In 1890, twenty stocks listed on the New York Exchange were selling
at an average price of about $87 per share. The percentage of loans
to deposits was about 95% and the percentage of specie to loans about
20%. In November of that year, loans advanced to 102% as compared
with deposits, and specie declined to about 18% of loans. The stocks
mentioned declined to an average price of $64 per share, and later in
1901 to about $61 per share. From 1891 to 1893 there was some alternate
improvement and retrogression in money conditions, all of which was
accurately reflected in stock prices.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>In 1893, the proportion of loans to deposits rose to about 109%, and
proportion of specie to loans declined to 13%. The average price of the
twenty stocks reached about $47 per share. (The panic of 1893).</p>

<p>In 1894, the proportion of loans to deposits fell to 80%, and specie
to loans rose to 30%. This was due to the liquidation of 1893. Stock
prices showed some betterment, rising to about $57 per share. The
severe drubbing of 1893 had made public investors nervous, and had in
many cases incapacitated them for stock market operations. That was to
come later.</p>

<p>In 1896, the proportion of loans to deposits rose to 102%, and specie
to loans fell to 10%. Stocks reached their lowest level in July of this
year ($42 per share for the twenty stocks mentioned).</p>

<p>From 1896 to 1898, a gradual improvement was apparent. Through all
this period stock prices faithfully reflected money conditions. In
July, 1898, the proportion of specie to loans rose to 30% and loans to
deposits fell to 83%. Stocks began advancing and in March, 1899, the
average price of the twenty stocks considered, was about $85 per share.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
<p>In June, 1900, the average price of the twenty stocks considered, was
about $75 per share. The proportion of specie to loans was about 22%,
and the proportion of loans to deposits was about 90%. From January,

1901, until September, 1902, money conditions did not improve, but
stocks continued to advance. There were large crops and a general wave
of expansion and prosperity swept the country. In September, 1902, the
proportion of loans to deposits was 99%, and the proportion of specie
to loans about 17%. Meanwhile stocks were high—$128 per share for
our twenty stocks. Conditions, though temporarily ignored, asserted
themselves in 1903, and in September of that year, the average price
of the twenty stocks was about $88 per share; the percentage of loans
to deposits 101% and specie to loans 19%. The money situation had not
changed materially, but the stock market was making a deferred payment.</p>

<p>In August, 1904, the proportion of loans to deposits had fallen to 90%
and specie to loans had risen to 25%. The stock market was steadily
advancing, and in January, 1906, stocks reached their pinnacle—$138
per share for the twenty securities considered.</p>

<p>It will be observed that while stock market movements do not always
immediately reflect good or bad conditions in the financial world, the
effect is ultimately felt. We are pretty safe in assuming that whenever
loans are unduly expanded and the percentage of specie is small, these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
conditions must be corrected either by a halt in business or by
liquidation; and the word liquidation here means a cleaning up in other
lines, as well as in the stock market. It is sometimes the case that
after the stock market has suffered a severe decline, there is little
improvement in the monetary situation as shown in the bank statement.
In January, 1907, for example, the percentage of loans to deposits
was about 102%, and specie to loans about 17½%. The average price
of twenty active stocks at that time, was about 130. At the present
writing (June, 1907) those same shares have fallen to an average price
of about 101, and there is no appreciable change in the relation of
loans to deposits, or specie to loans. On June 8th, 1907, the bank
statement showed loans to deposits 102%, and specie to loans a little
below 19%. This state of affairs would naturally lead to the belief
that unless we are vigorously assisted by some powerful factor, such as
good crops, we now face a period where either a decided slowing up or
an actual recession in general business is imperative. On this theory,
fortified or modified by a study of extraneous effects, the speculator
or investor may gain a valuable knowledge of probable future movements
in the stock market. If he decides that the case is a bad one and that
a set-back in business will occur, he may argue that, even if stocks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
are low in price, there is little hope of a material upward movement
in any quarter. It would also be evident that the industrial shares
would suffer more in price than the railroad shares; for, under
present conditions, a decline in the price of products generally helps
the railroad corporations to some extent by permitting advantageous
purchases. For instance, if finished steel and iron products decline in
price, the railroads might be enabled to carry out projected extensions
to better advantage than otherwise, while the manufacturing companies
would suffer a considerable loss of profits. It is, of course, true
that a recession in business is felt in all lines, but as the selling
rate of transportation is more fixed than prices of commodities, and
as the producing companies gain less by a recession in the prices of
the commodities they <i>buy</i> than do the railroads, the industrial
stocks are more adversely affected. This may appear as a sort of
compensation for the fact that while rates for transportation do not
advance as easily as prices of commodities, neither do they fall as
rapidly in periods of depression.</p>

<p>In examining the bank statement as a barometrical showing of money
conditions, it should be remembered that an increase in deposits does
not mean an increase in cash. The bank statement may show an increase
in loans of $1,000,000 and an increase in deposits based on these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
loans. That is to say, $1,000,000 may have been borrowed on commercial
paper, and the proceeds passed to the credit of the borrowers.
Commenting on this fact, Theodore Burton says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But in the modern development of banking the actual money deposited
is much less important in determining the amount of deposits, because
so large a share of them represents credits obtained by loans, etc.
These credits are transferred upon orders executed by depositors,
and furnish a substitute for currency. In proportion as payments
and settlements are made by checks, drafts, and bills of exchange,
deposits maintain an increased proportion to the amount of currency in
circulation. This class of deposits increases prior to a crisis rather
than diminishes, because loans increase.</p>

<p>“In the reports of national banks, there is a striking
correspondence from year to year in the volume of deposits and that
of loans and discounts. Deposits show more frequent fluctuations,
but rise and fall in general accord with loans and discounts. This
correspondence is easily explained. Another distinction should be
noted. Some deposits are the result of completed transactions, and
are based upon the proceeds of sales made, amounts realized from
investments, etc. Others merely represent loans or discounts the
proceeds of which are entered to the credit of the borrower. Before
every crisis there is an unusual proportion of deposits which are based
upon loans. If in bank statements there could be separate columns for
these two kinds of deposits, the information afforded by their increase
or decrease would be much more valuable.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
This point shows the necessity of considering not only the proportion of
loans to deposits but of specie to loans. On this point Mr. Burton says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“A continuous decrease of specie attended by an
increase in outstanding discounts is always a danger signal. The gap
between the two may widen for months, and even for years, and may
fluctuate from time to time, but a sudden change of large proportions,
or a steady decrease of the percentage of specie is an unfailing
indication of danger. The reason for this is not hard to discover.
The quantity of metallic money in a country shows what part of its
capital is available as money for the payment of its obligations to
foreign countries, the final test of availability. For this last named
purpose credit money cannot be used, but only money having intrinsic
value—money of the Mercantile Republic, as it is called by Adam Smith.”</p>

<p>The conclusion reached therefore, is that an increase in loans and
discounts with no corresponding increase in cash or with an actual
decrease in cash, reflects a bad state of affairs, even when the
advance in loans and discounts appears to be fully offset by deposits.</p>

<p>There is one feature which should not be overlooked. The very worst
state of affairs may be shown in the bank statement during a period
of great commercial activity and inflation in all lines. The reverse
is also true. In 1894, following the panic of 1893, the percentage of
loans to deposits fell to 80% and the percentage of specie to loans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rose to 30%; but no bull market occurred. This was due to stagnation in
all lines of business, a period of timidity and conservatism. In 1895,
there were signs of a great improvement and the stock market started
upward. This improvement, however, proved illusory and premature. Loans
rose quickly to 95% of deposits and specie fell below 15% of loans.
Then followed, in 1896, the new record of low prices.</p>

<p>In studying the bank statement for its effects on speculative prices,
surplus reserves will frequently suggest danger or safety. If surplus
reserves dwindle too near the vanishing point, the possibility of
necessary retiring of call loans is apparent.
(<a href="#BANK">See “Bank Statement,” page 125</a>).</p>

<p>It is possible to gain valuable knowledge by a careful examination of
the bank statement. The points made above are, of course, only of a
simple and elemental character. We may go on with our examination as
far as we like and scrutinize not only totals, but the position of
individual banks. Also, in order to gain a comprehensive perspective,
it will be expedient to examine, not only the barometer of the New York
situation, but the condition of interior banks. However, it is a pretty
good idea to begin with the A, B, C’s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>High rates for call money and the calling of loans are responsible for
many sharp market movements. A large class of speculators figure that
when dividend returns are high and call money cheap and plentiful, they
have a tangible influence working in their favor while they are long
of stocks. If rates for call money are 2% and a stock returns 6% there
is, eliminating speculation, an advantage of 4% per annum in favor of
the marginal speculator. This advantage is not so great in carrying
stocks on time loans, as rates for fixed periods are materially higher.
There is always danger of a flurry in call money, however, and in
the event of a wholesale calling of loans there arises the necessity
of selling stocks, and a decline occurs. There is also present the
element of manipulation in this quarter, and it cannot be gainsaid that
many instances have occurred where funds have been suddenly withdrawn
for the purpose of “shaking out” an undesirable following or of
accumulating securities to advantage; and on the other hand, call money
has frequently been made cheap in order to encourage purchases.</p>

<p>There are two periods of the year when the stock market is affected by
disbursements of money in the form of interest and dividends. The two
dates at which heavy disbursements occur, are January 1st and July 1st.
It is a popular belief that just prior to each of these dates, money
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
will grow “tight” because of the necessary provisions made by banks
and other corporations to meet such payments. Following the actual
distribution of funds, it is the theory that a part of this money will
seek reinvestment in bonds and shares. A great many speculators argue
that this would naturally produce stringency, the possible calling of
loans, and consequently lower security prices in the latter half of
December and June and an advance early in January and July. While this
reasoning looks sound enough on its face, it is not at all dependable.
It is certain that everything is discounted in advance of actual events
in speculative circles, and the more widely such theories as the one
mentioned are disseminated, the more dangerous and inoperative they
become. Instances are not lacking in recent years, where the technical
situation growing out of this reasoning, has not only nullified the
theoretical action, but has resulted in actual reversal, i.e.: an
advance just preceding disbursements and a decline at the time the
distributed funds were presumably returning to investment channels.
Numerous shrewd people, anticipating an advance in January and July,
have attempted to take time by the fore-lock by effecting purchases in
December and June. Their buying, being of a competitive character, not
only carries prices upward prematurely, but creates a weak speculative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
long interest, subject to disappointment if funds do not reappear in
the volume expected, or susceptible to attack by great manipulators.</p>

<p>There is another objection to this theory of periodicity. If the
market is dull and stagnant, with little public interest, it behooves
the large interests which have stocks for sale to bid up prices and
create activity prior to the heavy distributions of funds. They may
accomplish two things by this process. They make not only a higher
level of prices at which to sell their wares, but create what is of
even greater importance, an appearance of activity, prosperity and a
newspaper market. It is strangely illogical, but unquestionably true,
that people who would flatly refuse to enter a market at a low level of
prices will rush in to buy ten points higher if the factors of bustle
and excitement are present. Both the doctrine of common-sense and the
calculus of probabilities would establish the fact that each advance
brings us nearer the top, and each decline brings us nearer the bottom;
but few men can train themselves away from the idea that an upturn
already established does not indicate higher prices and vice versa. It
is a sort of enthusiasm which a minority understand, however, and make
good use of. The psychological effect of mere excitement is one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
explanations of the incontrovertible fact that the public usually buys
at high prices and sells at low prices.</p>

<p>The acceptance of certain periods or seasons as a guide to either
purchases or sales of stocks is, in the last analysis, merely a form
of chart-playing. It is natural to evade a studious examination
of the general business and monetary situation and to resort to a
simple, albeit a superficial diagnosis, which, being insufficient and
incomplete, is dangerous. It is suggested that while the double effects
of contraction prior to distribution should be understood and examined,
the only safe method is to go behind these temporary and periodical
changes and study the whole basic structure comprehensively. We may
find that money is in demand for the purpose of propping and sustaining
an unsound business condition, and that it will in all probability
fail to return in volume to the security markets. This occurred in
January, 1907, and the believers in a “January rise,” were badly
disappointed. Interest rates on money must also be given consideration.
If the commercial world is striving to secure funds at a higher rate
of interest than is offered on shares, money, or a good portion of it,
will go where interest returns are greatest. And in this regard it may
be said, that merely local interest rates are not always a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
indication of money affairs in the business world. Not long ago, the
writer, being suspicious of the claims of plentiful money and low rates
in New York, investigated the matter through Western bankers and found
that prime paper was being offered west of the Missouri River at much
higher rates. This was made particularly significant by the fact that
previously the borrowers had always been able to supply their needs at
home, and that the loans, being offered through brokers, really cost
about ½% more than was apparent on their face.</p>

<p>It is frequently interesting and instructive to examine the character
of collateral behind loans, and find out how large a percentage of this
collateral consists of stocks and like securities. Our stock market
might appear to be in a sold out condition, when, in reality, a very
bad technical condition obtained. The purely marginal speculative
account in New York City, or other important centers, is carried on
under certain flexible rules or customs as to the amount of money
loaned on certificates; but in cases where securities have been widely
purchased for cash by small holders, and, in the event of general
tightness in money or depression in business, made the basis of loans
in country banks, but we have, in fact, a very weak <i>marginal</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
public account. The home banker will loan more liberally to his
townsmen and will scrutinize the movements of prices or the stages of
the market less closely than the city banker, and the certificates
owned by small holders and deposited as collateral may, in the
aggregate, represent an enormous line of shares. It would be quibbling
to say that this situation represented anything less serious than
a weakly margined public line. If the market declined materially,
the bankers would be forced, in self-protection, to call for more
collateral, and the result would depend, as in all other cases, on
the ability of the individual holder to take care of himself. Such a
condition existed in U. S. Steel stocks in the depression of 1903, and
was pointed out at the time by the writer. The knowledge obtained was
based barometrically on information obtained from a number of bankers
in different localities.</p>

<p>While interest rates for both time and call money are frequently
fictitious, or of a temporary and artificial nature, and no set rules
can be laid down as to certain conditions in money and their immediate
effects upon security values, it is not difficult to gain a general
idea of underlying conditions. We have always at hand statistics which
will reflect faithfully the fundamental basis of the entire world
structure. But in this important division, as in most other branches of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
speculation, we often find that what is really important is absolutely
ignored, while matters of little moment are harped upon, or even made
the basis of operations. Thus, every habitue of brokerage offices
eagerly watches the bank statement or the rates on call money, and
knows nothing about the expansion of credits, even when such expansion
has reached a point that would make a crisis appear inevitable. No
better proof of this can be offered than the fact that our heaviest
business and greatest inflation, have frequently gone merrily forward
for a year or more under suicidal conditions. These conditions have
sometimes been so obvious, so forcible, that it would appear impossible
to view them with equanimity. In a majority of cases they were probably
not viewed at all, and the thoughtful men who pointed out the danger
have been called calamity howlers or pessimists. There is one great
check to education in this direction: great financiers who are most
conversant with actual conditions, seldom find it expedient to point
out the facts. Sometimes they, themselves, wish to dispose of their
holdings because of the obvious peril ahead and this process would not
be facilitated by gloomy predictions. On the other hand, it is too
often the case that these same gentlemen, finding it to their great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
advantage to disperse sunshine until their goods are sold, point
assiduously to the excellent business of the present, and neglect
to touch on the irrepressible future, which, after all, is the most
important question to the investor or speculator.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V<br>Political Influences, Crops, Etc.</h2>
</div>

<p>The possibility of legislation adverse to corporations is always
present as a market factor, and at times severe declines have been
recorded through such action. It is not always the case that such
legislation is truly a bear factor, although it is fashionable to so
interpret anything in the nature of legislative interference with
corporate affairs. It is the writer’s opinion that a great deal of
misunderstanding has recently arisen in regard to the attitude of
certain party leaders toward the heads of great railroad corporations.
The opinion has been widely fostered by opposing politicians and others
that the credit of railroad corporations was being badly impaired, and
the interests of stockholders jeopardized because investigations were
ordered as to the methods of individuals or directorates.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any reasonable man could, as the stockholder of
a corporation, or as a private citizen, object to having dishonest or
sharp practices on the part of the active management of the property in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
question exposed and prevented. Where it is shown that an individual,
in his capacity as the head of a business, has employed his office as a
means of juggling stocks or reaping enormous personal gains, it cannot
but be to the interest of stockholders to have such practices stopped.
If the means at issue are honest and legitimate, the benefits reaped
should go to the stockholders. It is impossible to reconcile any other
plan with equity and common honesty. Let us look at the matter without
the mystery that obscures the affairs of a great corporation.</p>

<p>Suppose a member of a certain firm, its manager, finding the firm
in need of funds, secures money at a high rate, and at great profit
to himself—is that right? Or is it the manager’s business to work
entirely in the interest of the partners he represents? Is it possible
for him to legitimately acquire personal profit of any kind in
administering the affairs of the firm? It is not sufficient to point
out that the manager’s action in securing funds redounded to the great
benefit of the business concern, or that his capability and shrewdness
were reflected in enormous partnership profits. His associates in
business are entitled to all, not a portion, of the gains secured in
the management of its affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
It is submitted that much of our recent legislation which is popularly
supposed to have injured stock values has, in reality, aimed to protect
the small holder and throttle the unscrupulous men who, while actually
in their employ, were milking their business of millions. Legislation
which effects publicity and simplicity in the affairs of corporations
is an unmixed benefit to the small investors.</p>

<p>It is almost invariably the case that when a great decline in stock
prices occurs, the set-back is popularly attributed to some factor
which, in reality, had little to do with the reversal. In the decline
of 1907, thousands of people attributed the inability of railroads
to borrow money at low rates of interest almost entirely to hostile
legislation. Apparently these rapid-fire thinkers did not know or
realize that interest rates had risen the world over, that there was
not a free money market in the world, and that money, instead of being
withheld from 4% issues, was fully employed in other lines. Such,
however, was the case; British Consols, French Rentes,—all the choice
securities of civilized countries had kept pace with the declines in
our own bonds and stocks; but these facts seem to be unappreciated.</p>

<p>It is true that adverse legislation sometimes seriously impairs the
value of a security. A public utilities company, for example, which is
forced to reduce its selling rate, is unquestionably injured from an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
investment point of view. Such legislation, however, may be weighed
correctly by a little calm consideration, and it may be said that
action of this nature is usually for the purpose of correcting
abuses, rather than as a revengeful and confiscatory attack on vested
interests. Measures which prevent a fair return on capital will perish
of their own iniquity. So far as measures which are formed to prevent
extortion are concerned, it is impossible to criticize them.</p>

<p>In order to correctly weigh the effects of legislative measures on
security values and prices, we must therefore examine fairly what
the legislation seeks to accomplish, taking care not to allow a
contemporaneous price movement which may be due to other causes, to act
as a verification of a false view. This error occurs very frequently;
in fact, one of the most remarkable things about speculation is that
the true causes of great movements are fully appreciated by the
majority <i>only in retrospect</i>.</p>

<p>The probable market effect of legislative and political affairs can be
correctly gauged only by examining the nature and importance of the
issue in question. This is true not only of state and municipal action,
but in regard to presidential elections. There is a popular idea
that it is dangerous to buy stocks on the eve of a new presidential
campaign, but there is not much in history to uphold the view. True, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
a majority of cases, a decline has preceded such a contest, but there
have been frequent reversals of this action, and we have had too few
elections to attempt any chart-playing on this influence. Such a guide
would be empirical.</p>

<p>The issues involved in a presidential contest, however, may sometimes
influence prices. Here again a careful examination of facts and
probabilities will generally uncover the truth. If the nominee of one
party stands on a dangerous platform and the outcome of the contest is
in doubt, we may well dispose of shares if for no better reason than
that the element of danger is present. Danger, whether or not it is
finally realized, is a bear factor, just as safety is a bull factor.</p>

<p>Tariff agitation should be accorded careful consideration by the
speculator. This is particularly true as regards the effect on
industrial corporations. A reduction of the present tariff on Iron and
Steel, for instance, would materially lower, if not destroy, the value
of many of the common stocks of steel manufacturing corporations. A
very clear and comprehensive work on this subject is mentioned in the
bibliography on page 183.</p>

<p>No cut and dried rules or suggestions can be offered as to the effects
of political or legislative issues on prices. Each point must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
scrutinized as it arises, and judgment formed thereon. Sympathetic
movements will sometimes occur because of apprehension or
misunderstanding, but such effects will be short-lived.</p>

<h3><i>Crops and Crop Failures.</i></h3>

<p>The question of crop failures is of great importance. It is not
difficult to form a fairly correct idea as to the ultimate yield. The
estimates of the Government sometimes go wide of the mark, but it must
be remembered that they are <i>estimates</i> and nothing more, and
that conditions may change somewhat after the figures are compiled.
The speculator is frequently confused by the conflicting opinions
of private experts. It is probably safer to disregard the various
authorities and pin one’s faith to the computations of the bureau at
Washington. These official documents have been criticized at times,
and no doubt the criticism has been warranted, but they form our most
dependable source of information and will improve as time rolls on.</p>

<p>A crop failure, or a short crop, invariably brings forth much
fallacious vaporing from the rooters of Wall Street. They are as bad in
their efforts to obscure the truth as are the crop-killers with their
fabrications. A crop failure is a serious thing and must be faced as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
such. The contention which is always heard in lean seasons, that the
evil has been counter-acted because of the large reserves of Wheat,
Corn or Cotton in farmers’ hands is ridiculous. Farm reserves are
wealth. They have already found their place in the business structure.
In many cases the money they represent has already been spent in the
form of credits. Nor do high prices for cereals or cotton overcome the
evils of short production. Small crops mean decreased employment for
laborers; a diminution of per capita purchasing power, and increased
cost of living. They also mean smaller tonnage for the railroads, and
consequently decreased earnings.</p>

<p>And in examining crop prospects, we should consider the fact that each
year’s normal crop should be larger than the one preceding it. This is
distinctly shown by tracing production back for a term of years.</p>

<p>There will, of course, be fluctuations in this gradual increase, but
the tendency is certain. We may also consider that as railroads are
constantly extending their lines and increasing their facilities, it
follows that increased production in the commodities they transport is
necessary to their well being.</p>

<p>And short crops the world over in the same year have the same elements
of economic evil. The purchasing power of the world is reduced, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
even if we ourselves make fair crops and export them at high prices,
the world’s poverty is felt in lack of demand for other exportable
surplus. The civilized world is too closely knit together in its
affairs to permit of the entire localization of the effects of a
serious property loss.</p>

<p>A lean crop year can probably do more to temporarily injure the actual
<i>value</i> of railroad shares than can any other single influence
bearing on prices. Tonnage is affected both ways, so is passenger
traffic. There is less grain or cotton to haul to the markets, and, as
purchasing power has been reduced in the affected localities, there is
less freight to haul back to the producers. In the last analysis, the
products of a community represent to a great extent the mere exchange
of these products for other luxuries and necessities, and the effect of
decreased production is a two-edged sword, so far as the transporting
companies are concerned.</p>

<h3><i>Accidents.</i></h3>

<p>The effect of accidents on stock prices has been fully discussed in a
former work, and the contention offered that accidents could no more be
provided against, or considered, in the investment or speculative world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
than in any other walk of life. It is also thought that accidents are
more frequently the <i>excuse</i> for movements than the <i>cause</i>
of them. If a market is in a bad technical or general condition, the
slightest adverse happening may create panic; while if the foundation
is sound, even a great calamity, such as the San Francisco earthquake,
will cause only a temporary halt. The man who speculates correctly has
little to fear from accidents.

<p class="blockquot">In the following section of this work, the writer
has undertaken to touch on such features as appear of most interest and
benefit to the speculator or investor. Some of the matter presented,
such as the question of dividend dates, will appear to many readers so
simple as to be unnecessary, but it is true, nevertheless, that many
very elementary facts are misunderstood or unappreciated by a large
class of public participators.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br>Puts and Calls</h2>
</div>

<p>Puts and Calls, or “privileges,” have long been popular with a certain
trading element, either as a protection against loss in commitments
already made, or as a positive method of trading.</p>

<p>The theory and operation of privileges may be easily understood by
considering them in the light of insurance, the money paid for them as
a premium, and the funds received in case the privilege is exercised,
as a loss paid by the insurance company. It will be understood, that in
speaking of the <i>seller</i> of puts or calls, the insurance company
is referred to, and that the <i>buyer</i> represents the insured party.</p>

<p>The <i>buyer</i> of a call has the right to <i>call</i> for his shares
or commodity, at the price named in the contract at any time before its
maturity. The <i>seller</i> of a call fixes a certain price at which he
agrees to <i>deliver</i> stock, specifies the duration or time limit of
the contract, and receives from the buyer a certain sum or premium.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>For example: United States Steel Common is selling at $40 per share; A,
the seller, offers a call on 100 shares at 43, good for ten days, at
a price of say, $100. B, the purchaser, pays the $100 and receives a
contract from A as specified above. Now suppose that at any time before
the expiration of the period named, Steel Common advances to 50. B can
call for the delivery of 100 shares of Steel at 43, and by selling it,
reaps a profit of $700, less the cost of the privilege, ($100), and
the brokerage. Used as a protective measure on short sales, the result
would be the same, as $700 would have been saved. That is to say, if A
is short of Steel at 40 and it advances to 50, his call has acted as
insurance against any loss over and above the $300 represented by the
rise from 40 to 43.</p>

<p>The “put” is exactly the reverse of the “call,” and is insurance
against a decline; or, in other words, an agreement to receive shares
at a specified price on or before a certain date.</p>

<p>Using the same illustration as before, let us assume that the price of
Steel Common is 40, and that A, the seller, offers a put at 37, good
for 10 days, at a price of $100. B, the buyer, is now insured against
any loss which may accrue through a decline below 37 in the ensuing ten
days. If he is long of the stock and it declines to 30, he may deliver
his shares to A at 37, or if he has purchased the “put” as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
speculation, he may buy 100 shares in the market at 30 and deliver to
B at 37, netting a profit of $700, less the price paid for “put” and
brokerage.</p>

<p>One of the favorite methods of trading in privileges is to buy or
sell against them when the price named is reached. For example, say B
holds a ten day “put” on Steel Common at 37, and the market for the
stock declines to 36 in five days. He may now buy 100 shares at 36 on
the theory that he has regained his original outlay of $100 and has
a possibility of profit through market action in the remaining five
days, while there is no possibility of loss. If the market advances
to, say 38, he may sell the one hundred shares purchased, and on
another decline to 37 or 36 may again purchase, repeating the operation
indefinitely during the life of his put. The “Call” is, of course, made
the basis of short sales on an exact reversal of this process. This
fashionable form of exercising privileges is facilitated by the fact
that “puts and calls” issued by members of the New York Stock Exchange,
are generally accepted by brokers as “margins”; B having paid A $100
for a “put,” as illustrated above, could, if Steel declined to 37 or
below that figure, buy 100 Steel and give his broker the privilege
issued by A, in lieu of a marginal deposit. The broker is satisfied, as
he gains a commission, and in the event of a further decline in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
price of Steel can call on A to receive the stock at 37 when the option
expires.</p>

<p>Another popular form of trading in privileges is to buy or sell half
the amount named in the privilege when it becomes “good” through market
action. If B holds a “put” on 100 Steel at 37, he may, at that price
or below, buy 50 shares. He is now in a position to profit by either
an advance or a decline. If the price advances to 40 he has three
points profit in the 50 shares purchased. If, on the other hand, the
market declines to 34, he still gains 3 points on 50 shares, for his
“put” protects him against a loss in the 50 shares purchased and he can
purchase another 50 shares at 34 and deliver to A at 37. In short, when
he makes his 50 share purchase at 37, he is both short and long of the
stock and must gain on a movement either way in the market price.</p>

<p>A “Straddle,” as the term is applied to privileges, is a combined “put
and call”. The purchaser gains on a movement in either direction. The
general rule is that the gain is to be represented by a market change
representing an excess of the amount paid for the “Straddle.” Thus if
A sells to B for $250, a straddle on 100 shares of Steel, when the
current market for the stock is 40, B is in a position to gain by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
either an advance above 42½ or a decline below 37½.</p>

<p>The purchasers of privileges are sometimes perplexed by market changes
which are brought about by dividend payments. The rule is that the
dividend always goes with the stock. The simplest way to arrive at
correct figures is, to mentally lower the price of either the “put” or
“call,” by the exact amount of the dividend payment. Thus, if B holds
a “call” on Steel at 43 and a dividend of 2% is paid on the stock
during the life of his option, his “call” becomes operative at 41 as
the dividend goes to him. If he holds a “put” at 37, and 2% dividend is
paid on the stock, his “put” is not operative until 35 is reached, as
the dividend goes to the maker of the “put.”</p>

<p>Privileges in grain or other commodities are based on the same general
rules and principles as those on stocks. These privileges are heavily
dealt in on wheat and corn in Chicago. They are designated, however, as
“ups” and “downs” in order to evade local laws prohibiting transactions
in “puts and calls.” The “ups” are calls; the “downs” are puts. Most of
the grain privileges handled in Chicago, or based on Chicago prices,
are of a day to day character, insuring only for the next day’s price
changes. The ordinary charge is $1 per thousand bushels. For $1,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
therefore, the small gambler, or speculator, may purchase, say a call
on 1,000 bushels of wheat at 90½ when the last price recorded was 90.
If wheat reaches 91½ during the next day’s session, he has a gain of
$10 less the cost of the “call” and brokerage.</p>

<p>The small capital required for this form of trading, the fact that
loss is limited to the original cost of the privilege, and the great
possibilities in case of extreme movements, make “puts and calls”
very popular. It may be said, however, that they are, as a rule, poor
property. The writer kept account of the transactions in “puts and
calls” handled through a large concern for almost two years and found
that only about 35% of the money paid for these privileges returned
to the purchasers. That is to say, the profit shown to purchasers of
“puts,” “calls,” and “straddles,” was only about $350 out of each
$1,000 received by the sellers. After deducting the item of commission
charges, it was found that the sellers of privileges reaped over
50% profit each year. The experiment referred to was based on grain
privileges, but would probably hold good in stocks. The <i>sellers</i>
of these “puts and calls” are among the brightest men in the street,
and when they make prices they do so on the absolute basis that they
have the best of the bargain and the buyers are usually a public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
element. In the test referred to, there were never three consecutive
days when either “puts” or “calls” were good. There was on one occasion
in the period consulted, an advance of over 20 cents a bushel in wheat
in three days, but “calls” were good only on the first day of the
advance. On this occasion the “calls” were good for about 2 cents per
bushel on the first day’s rise, but the sellers offered nothing for
the second day, except at prices far above the market, and although
the market advanced 6 cents per bushel, wheat was not “called.” On the
third day, prices for “calls” were prohibitive, ranging from ten to
twenty cents above the closing price and again wheat was not called,
although the market advanced 8½ cents.</p>

<p>In the accounts examined, one seller of privileges on wheat had an open
order to sell 100 puts and 100 calls every day at the ruling price. He
thus received $200 daily and invariably “took his loss” whenever the
privileges operated against him. That is to say, if wheat closed one
cent per bushel above the call price, he would be called for 100,000
bushels on his privileges, making him short that amount of wheat.
This he bought in at once and pocketed a loss of $1,000 less the $200
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
received. Although he accepted some severe losses now and then, his
account showed over $30,000 profit on a year’s business.</p>

<p>Another account was operated on a different principle by the seller of
privileges and resulted in even larger profits. This individual would
sell ten “puts” and ten “calls” on wheat each day. In the event of his
being called, i.e., short of the wheat, he would, on the next day sell
no “calls,” but 20 “puts.” In the event of a decline below the “put”
price, he had enough short wheat to protect ten of his “puts” and in
reality automatically close out his ten thousand short, frequently at
a profit. As has been stated, his profits were greater than in the
first instance quoted. There was, of course, a more highly speculative
element in his form of operating than in the other method, but the
operator was never either long or short more than 10,000 bushels,
and received about $6,000 a year or 60 cents per bushel from his
privileges, in addition to the accruing of profit or the curtailing of
loss by his mechanical method.</p>

<p>In the accounts examined the persistent purchasers of privileges all
finally lost money, except in a few cases where lines acquired on
“puts or calls” were carried to a successful conclusion in the course
of time. That is, a purchaser of “calls,” finding a profit in his
privilege, would call the wheat and <i>keep</i> it. This, however,
resolved the matter into pure speculation, as the maximum benefits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
derived from this form of trading can only be correctly measured by
the profit shown at the expiration of the “put” or “call.” That is to
say, the seller need suffer no greater loss than that shown when the
contract he has given matures, and consequently the profit to the buyer
cannot be greater except through speculation.</p>

<p>It would appear from these facts, that the purchasing of privileges is
a poor business proposition, while the selling of privileges is a money
making affair. This is true. We need only compare the kind of men who
<i>buy</i> “puts and calls” and those who sell them to have this truth
made apparent. The late Russell Sage was a persistent writer of these
instruments and made a great deal of money by the process. The late
Edward Partridge also made a good deal of money in this manner in the
Chicago Wheat Market. He also used privileges to aid his manipulative
campaigns. On several occasions, he sold “calls” heavily through the
day, then suddenly bid wheat up just at the close of the market,
effecting a closing just above the call price. The scattered purchasers
would call the wheat and put Mr. Partridge short several millions at a
high price, which was just what he wanted. He could not have sold as
much wheat in the open market without breaking the price several cents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
On the same principle, he used sometimes to sell a great many “puts”
when he wished to cover a line of short wheat and rush the price
downward at the close, thus enabling him to purchase a great line
without disturbing the market by bidding for it. The process only
worked a few times, however. As soon as it was discovered it failed, as
the call price, when reached, met with such a wave of selling that it
was impossible to break through it, and the manipulator was “hoist with
his own petard.”</p>

<p>There is another drawback to the habit of buying privileges—a mental
one. They are frequently made the basis of positive trading with
disastrous results. The man who believes in an advance in certain
shares or commodities, frequently purchases privileges instead of
following out his own convictions by actual trading. Thus the man
who had good reasons for expecting an advance in wheat at the time
of the 20 cent advance mentioned above, and who used either “puts”
or “calls” or both, as a means of operating on his opinions, would
have reaped less than two cents a bushel during an advance of twenty
cents. He might, of course, have called the wheat on the first day
of the advance and remained long, but in that case he would merely
have been speculating with equal chance of loss or profit in ensuing
transactions. Aside from the initial two cent gain, he would have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
in no different position than if he had purchased and held the cereal
on margin.</p>

<p>It is the writer’s opinion, founded on the experience set forth above,
that it is much better to effect transactions in the ordinary manner,
than to depend on privileges. If “puts and calls” are dealt in at all,
they should be sold, not purchased. The insurance companies make more
money than is paid out in losses; so do the sellers of privileges. It
may be well to add, however, that the man who runs an insurance company
is in danger if he does not understand his business and his risks,
or if he enters the field without sufficient capital to provide for
possible initial losses. All this applies to the seller of privileges.

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br>The Question of Dividends</h2>
</div>

<p>It is a certainty that the short seller of dividend-paying stocks
suffers a drawback from dividends, except in the rare cases where
interest is allowed on short stocks. If we sell short a 6% stock at par
and at the end of a year find the stock still selling at par, we have
lost 6% without adverse market action. This onus cannot be escaped by
short-time commitments; it is merely a matter of degree. The chronic
short seller is swimming constantly against the current.</p>

<p>There is one point about dividends which is widely misunderstood
by ordinary traders. It appears impossible to make a great many
individuals understand that short sales may be as intelligently made
the day before a stock sells “ex-dividend” as at any other time. Even
when good reasons for a decline exist, traders fight shy of “swallowing
the dividend,” or retire commitments just before dividend payment for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
no other reason than that such distribution is to be made, which is, in
fact, no reason at all.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to the seller of stocks through the earning
capacity or increment is the same on the day or the week preceding
a disbursement as at any other time. The earnings of the company
are a steady day to day affair, and are, as they accrue, constantly
considered in the price of the stock. In other words, the prices of
listed shares are at all times “flat.” At a point midway between two
dividend days, the stock reflects in its current price half the amount
of the undistributed dividend, or other increment. For example, if a
certain stock sells normally at par and pays 6% per annum (3 per cent.
in January and 3 per cent. in July) the price of the stock in March,
eliminating speculative influences, would be 101½ and in July 103.
When on July 1st, the 3 per cent. is distributed, the amount is simply
taken away from the company and from the price of the stock also. It
now returns to its normal price, 100, and whether it will go up or down
from that point is a question for speculation. The factor which made
the price 103 has been eliminated and it remains for the corporation in
question to again earn 3% available for distribution before the next
dividend day.</p>

<p>Perhaps this point may be made clearer by assuming that a certain stock
is not handled on the “flat” basis, but is dealt in “and interest”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
after the method sometimes employed in bond transactions. Let us again
eliminate speculation and take for example a stock selling at 100 and
paying 6%. Assuming that a dividend had been paid on this stock on
January 1st, the purchaser of the stock on February 1st would pay 100
for his shares, and would also pay to the seller the accrued dividend
for one month, or ½ of 1% which is exactly the same proposition as if
the stock had been quoted flat on the Stock Exchange at 100½. On March
1st, the purchaser would pay 100 for his shares and 1% accrued dividend
or 101, etc.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the widespread idea that it is dangerous
to sell a stock just before a dividend day is not sound. In fact, the
whole matter may be dismissed by saying that if there was any good
or logical reason for expecting a premature recovery of the price
of dividend-paying shares, or an advance founded on any reason in
connection with dividends other than the gradual accumulation from one
date of disbursement to the next, the whole problem of making profits
in Wall Street would be solved. The rule must necessarily work both
ways, and if it is dangerous to sell at certain periods, it must be, in
inverse ratio, safe to purchase. All we would need to do therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
would be to await the dates on which shares sold “ex-dividend” and make
purchases. Here then, is exploited a patent way of getting the best of
the market without study or effort. In truth, there is nothing whatever
in the theory any more than there would be in buying Government bonds
for a rise just after the interest had been paid on them. If good
reasons exist for sales, they may be made as confidently at one time as
another. The disadvantage of being short of dividend-paying stocks is
always present, and it cannot be escaped, but the operation is a day to
day affair not a matter of certain dates.</p>

<h3 id="BRV"><i>Basing Railroad Values.</i></h3>

<p>“The problem of railway valuation is comparatively simple, and
beyond the reach of but few. A railway is primarily a carrier, a
carter, a drayman. Obviously then, in considering an investment, we
shall ask, What sort of a road has it? What sort of vans, and what sort
of horses? What sort of trade? A teamster doing business on a fine
level macadamized road, with big, heavy vans, and heavy draft horse,
can work at a profit and underbid a carrier with old vans and poor
horses, working on roads of heavy grade. So, for example, a railroad,
other things being equal, with a water grade like the New York Central,
has a tremendous advantage over an up and down grade like that of the
Erie. The Illinois Central can do business much more cheaply than the
Missouri Pacific. A road with a magnificent equipment like the Lake
Shore can undercut a poorly equipped road like the Nickel Plate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“The initial facts that we wish to know of a railway then are, What
sort of a road has it, what is its traffic, does it get good rates?
When we know what business it does, what its earnings are, then we
shall ask, how is it capitalized, what are the fixed charges these
earnings have to bear, what is there left, and what is the amount of
stock which has to share the surplus? We shall ask if its earnings
are stable, if the maintenance is adequate, if the policy of the road
is conservative, if its management is good or bad. When we have done
all this, then we shall go into the market, ask the prevalent rate
of money, and by a simple rule of thumb, we shall know, in a broad
way, whether the stock is cheap or dear.”—From “American Railways as
Investments,” by Carl Snyder.</p>

<h3 id="EFFECTS"><i>The Effects of Business Depression<br> on Rails and Industrials.</i></h3>

<p>“There is apparently a popular belief that the general market always
moves together in a considerable swing, and that any advance in one set
of stocks would be accompanied by a corresponding advance in others. So
far as the general tone of a day’s market is concerned this is true;
but, nevertheless, individual stocks or groups of stocks can easily
and gradually change their selling basis in a brief period of time. In
1901, for example, the industrial stocks reached their high levels, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
suffered a considerable decline in 1902. Meanwhile the rails were
advancing. To illustrate and confirm this statement the highest prices
of both Rails and Industrials in July, 1901, and July, 1902, are set
forth in the following tables. There can be no unfairness in choosing
this particular period. What is to be demonstrated is that it is
possible for the groups to cross each other in price in a given time.
The ten most active stocks have been chosen in each group as fairly
representative of the entire market:</p>

“These tables show that during the fiscal year used, railroad stocks
advanced an average of over 15 points, while industrials declined
almost 14 points. In other words, the spread was 29 points. The man who
bought rails and sold industrials would have made on the average 29
points. This exhibit entirely overthrows any argument that the market
moves one way or the other homogeneously.</p>

<p>“There was a reason for the spread illustrated above. There always is
a reason. We had big crops in 1902, which helped the railroads. The
industrials, on the other hand, were busily discounting the business
depression of 1903.</p>

<p>“Precedent shows that in a period of general depression Industrial
stocks suffer about 33% more than rails. That is to say, in the high
and low prices covering a long period, industrial securities should
show a distinctly greater pro-rata of decline. Let me illustrate, using
the stocks employed in the former table and covering the period of our
last great cycle, 1901-02-03. As most of the high prices in rails were
made in 1902, the highest prices of both 1901 and 1902 will be used,

<p>“It will be observed from the above table that Industrials declined
about 51 points while rails declined about 48 points. But the decline
cannot be figured in points. The higher range of railroad shares must
be considered. A decline of two points in a stock selling at 100 is
only equivalent to a decline of one point in a stock selling at 50.
Therefore, in order to get a correct view of the matter, we must reduce
the decline to percentages. On this basis, railroad stocks lost about
38% of their value, and industrial stocks lost about 60% of their
value.”—From Thomas Gibson’s Market Letter, May 4th, 1907.</p>

per hundred shares of the original holding to be subscribed for, and
add the value of these new shares at the subscription price to the cost
of one hundred shares at the market price; then divide the total cost
of both old and new shares by the total number of shares, and deduct
the average price from the market quotations. This gives the selling value
of the rights.”—From “American Railways as Investments,” by Carl Snyder.</p>

<h3 id="BAROMETER"><i>Barometer of Averages.</i></h3>

<p>“In order to facilitate the examination of properties and their
comparative condition, the following table has been prepared. The
figures were arrived at by averaging the operating expenses, fixed
charges, margin of safety, and dividends of principal properties for
the last fiscal year. The stock prices are based upon the closing
figures of June 6, 1907. The margin of safety shown, is the margin over
common dividends. Results were as follows:</p>

<table class="spb1">
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Average operating expenses&emsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="tdr">69.01%</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Average fixed charges</td>
      <td class="tdr">54.70%</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Average margin of safety</td>
      <td class="tdr">5.28%</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Average dividend common</td>
      <td class="tdr">6.03%</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Average price of stock</td>
      <td class="tdr">1.09⅝</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>“As in all computations of this kind the figures are comparative
and not basic. The fact that one stock is in a much better position
than others does not necessarily mark that stock as a purchase, for
<i>all</i>stocks may be too high, and underlying conditions may not
warrant purchases in any quarter. Again, we must always consider the
fact that important elements which cannot be tabulated in figures may
be present. However, the table possesses value as a rough barometer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and after it has been broadly applied, specific influences may be given
due consideration. If, for example, we find a common stock selling
well below 109⅝, with operating expenses below 69.01; fixed charges
below 54.70; margin of safety above 5.28 and the dividend rate above
6%, we have a remarkable combination of facts favoring the shares and
investigation will be stimulated. The figures vary widely at times in
different corporations and cannot always be considered either bullish
or bearish, as the good or bad features may be already discounted
in the current price of the shares. It may also be found that one
property is going backward gradually while another is improving its
position.—From Thomas Gibson’s Market Letter, June 8th, 1907.</p>

<h3 id="METHOD"><i>The Best Method of Trading.</i></h3>

<p>“It may appear that if the market is to sway back and forth, sales
on advances, and purchases on declines would offer the maximum of
opportunity to the shrewd trader. But not so. To illustrate this,
a market movement from high to low prices as shown by a chart is
presented on the following page.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“As simple as this illustration may appear, it is
worthy of most earnest consideration. True, the upward and downward
movements show opportunities on both sides, but if the <i>purchaser</i>
makes a mistake, as all speculators will, he is hopelessly involved.
If he buys at the wrong point he will never see daylight during the
progress of the movement. Look at the other side of the matter. The
<i>seller</i> cannot make a mistake. No matter at what point he sells a
profit lies before him. A little reflection will show what a tremendous
difference exists here.”—From Thomas Gibson’s Market Letter, Feb. 2nd, 1907.

<p>“Preceding Indications.—This preceding period is
characterized by well-defined indications, some of
which develop contemporaneously, but which, so far
as they are distinct in time, occur in approximately
the following order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">“1—An increase in prices, first, of special
commodities, then, in a less degree, of commodities generally, and
later of real estate, both improved and unimproved.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“2—Increased activity of established enterprises,
and the formation of many new ones, especially those which provide
for increased production or improved methods, such as factories and
furnaces, railways and ships, all requiring the change of circulating
to fixed capital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">“3—An active demand for loans at slightly higher
rates of interest.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“4—The general employment of labor at increasing
or well-sustained wages.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“5—Increasing extravagance in private and public
expenditure.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“6—The development of a mania for speculation,
attended by dishonest methods in business and the gullibility of many
investors.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">“7—Lastly, a great expansion of discounts and
loans, and a resulting rise in the rate of interest; also a material
increase in wages, attended by frequent strikes and by difficulty in
obtaining a sufficient number of laborers to meet the demand.”—From

<h3 id="SAFETY"><i>The Factor of Safety.</i></h3>

<p>“There remains but one point to which, in view of the conditions
roughly sketched above, the writer would call especial attention.
That is, that the investor should look well, always, to the factor of
safety. Before he puts his money into any road, no matter if it be on
the recommendation of the greatest banker in the United States, let him
consider how far that company is prepared to weather a storm. Few roads
ever prospered under receivership, no matter how honest or how able.
The receivership itself is a handicap. No matter how high the yield, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
investor whose primary regard should be the safety of his money
will put it into a road whose fixed charges, after ample charges
for maintenance, consume much more than 50% of the total net income
available for interest, dividends and improvements—that is, save in
exceptional cases like the New York Central—and until he has satisfied
himself thoroughly that the property is sound.</p>

<p>“For the convenience of those not well acquainted, the following list
of the principal roads is given, with the percentage of total net
income consumed by fixed charges in the highly prosperous fiscal year
of 1905:</p>

<p>“The high degree of stability imparted to interest payments and
dividends by a low percentage of fixed charges, and the high degree
of instability imparted by a large percentage, is so elementary that
it would seem to need no emphasis. And yet this item is habitually
disregarded by perhaps 90% of bond and stock buyers. On this account it
may be worth while to illustrate by simple comparison the effect of a
20% decline in gross or net earnings. We will compare the conditions of
two roads whose fixed charges are respectively 75% and 25% of the total
net income. The operation would be as follows:</p>

<p>“It will be seen from the above that a 20% decline in the net earnings
would, in the first instance, mean a decrease of 80% in the surplus;
while in the second case, the same decline would mean a decrease of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
only 26% in the surplus—figures which sufficiently indicate what a
high percentage of fixed charges means.</p>

<p>“In this connection it may be further noted that in the large holding
companies, like the Pennsylvania, the New York Central, the Union
Pacific, and others, the factor of safety and the surplus shown tends
to be relatively more stable than in companies largely or exclusively
dependent upon the earnings of their own roads. This is due to the
general custom of American Railways of paying out in dividends only a
part of the actual surplus earned. From this it results that dividends
are much more stable than earnings, and that the income of the
holding companies from this source will correspondingly show smaller
fluctuations than earnings. When, therefore, as in the case of some
of the large holding companies named, the income from investments
represents a considerable portion of the total net income shown, the
surplus, other things being equal, will be much more stable than in
other companies.</p>

<p>“It is needless to add that this stability is still further heightened
when, as in the case of the Pennsylvania, Union Pacific and some other
roads, the percentage of fixed charges is at the same time low.”—From
“American Railways as Investments,” by Carl Snyder.</p>

<h3 id="BORROW"><i>Borrowing and Lending Stocks.</i></h3>

<p>“When a speculator sells stock which he does not possess (when he sells
it short) he (or what is the same thing, the broker who acts for him)
has to borrow the stock to make delivery to the purchaser. The one who
possesses stock (who is long of it) is, in ordinary circumstances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
as anxious to lend it as the one who has sold it short is anxious to
borrow it.</p>

<p>“The lender of stock receives from the borrower the market value of it
in money, but except when the stock is lending flat (without interest)
or at a premium, the lender of the stock pays to the borrower of it
interest on the money paid for the stock by the borrower. The rate of
interest is determined by bid and offer.</p>

<p>“On the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who have stocks to borrow and
brokers who have stocks to lend assemble immediately after the close
of business on the exchange and those who need stocks borrow amounts
necessary to make deliveries the next day. Those who neglect to borrow
at this time must do so the next morning, or some time in the day
before the delivery hour, 2.15 p. m. There is no loan crowd in the
morning, but borrowers seek lenders at the posts on the floor of the
exchange around which the particular stocks that they require are dealt in.</p>

<p>“The same rules govern the receipt and delivery of stocks borrowed and
loaned as govern stocks bought and sold. In returning borrowed stock
the borrower must notify the lender before 1 o’clock on the day of
delivery; the lender in calling or demanding the return of stock must
do likewise.</p>

<p>“When a stock is loaned flat, the owner is relieved from the cost of
carrying the stock. If loaned at a premium he is still better off, for
the premium is so much gain. When a stock is loaned at a premium, the
premium applies in the absence of a renewal of the loan only to the day
on which the stock is loaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
“If a stock that has been borrowed advances in market price the lender
may require the borrower to pay to him the difference between the
price at which the stock was loaned and the new higher price. On the
other hand, if the stock declines in price the borrower may require
the lender of the stock to return to him the difference between the
price at which the stock was borrowed and the new lower price. These
differences are called market differences.</p>

<p>“When a corner is being worked up in a stock it is the practice of
those engineering it freely to loan the stock in order to encourage the
creation of a short interest in it. When this short interest has become
large enough, or in other words, when the stock has become sufficiently
oversold, a demand for the return of the stock brings the corner to a
culmination.</p>

<p>“An apparent borrowing demand for stocks is sometimes created by the
efforts of money lenders to obtain higher interest on their money than
is obtainable in lending it in the money market. If the lending rate
for a particular stock is, say, 6 per cent. when money is lending at 4½
per cent. in the money market the money lenders will borrow the stock
in order to obtain the extra interest.</p>

<p>“When a seller of long stock (stock actually owned) desires to create
the impression that he is selling short stock (stock not owned or
possessed) he has his broker borrow stock for delivery to purchasers.
Then when he has completed his sales he delivers his own stock to the
ones from whom his broker borrowed.</p>

<p>“Also, when a seller of stock desires to conceal his identity, he has
his stock transferred or made out in the name of his broker, or a
clerk, or some other person previous to its delivery to purchasers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Arbitrage dealers often sell stock held abroad which will not be
received for some time. They borrow for delivery to purchasers and when
their own stock arrives they make returns to the ones from whom they
borrowed.</p>

<p>“Corporations intending to issue new stock have been known to sell
the stock in advance of its issuance and to borrow to make delivery
to purchasers. Then when the new stock was issued it was used to make
return to the ones from whom stock had been borrowed.”—From Smith’s
Financial Dictionary, by Howard Irving Smith.</p>

<h3 id="SCALP"><i>Scalping.</i></h3>

<p>“There are many different methods and degrees of scalping. The word is
supposed to express all the forms of trading between the “Chaser of
eighths” and the man who operates for a profit of several points.</p>

<p>“Scalping operations are more common than any other form of trading.
There are several reasons for this. Many people consider the market a
machine, and base operations on pictures of the past, i. e., charts.
These misused and mischievous instruments show so many opportunities
of profit in movements both ways, that the unsophisticated trader sees
what was <i>possible</i>, while the <i>probable</i> is overlooked.</p>

<p>“Again, the desire to scalp is helped by impatience and greed. The
small trader will grow disgusted if there is the slightest delay.
Dullness is unbearable to him. Also, he will frequently close good
commitments merely for the sake of ‘seeing the money.’ I have seen many
traders ‘clean up,’ receive a check which was of absolutely no present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
use to them, gloat over it for a while, and pay another commission to
replace the trades. Ridiculous, but true.</p>

<p>“I may say, as a general principle, that I consider scalping the
poorest form of trading. It involves the continued multiplication of
commissions, and constant personal attention. I know of but two men who
have made any considerable amount of money by scalping methods. They
are exceptionally fitted for this form of trading, and have the ability
to take a small loss quickly. This is a trait which is very rare among
public traders. A man will usually accept a small profit for no other
reason than that it <i>is</i> a profit, and will sit stubbornly on a
loss for no other reason than that it is a loss.</p>

<p>“The man who has reason to believe that a stock will advance or decline
ten points, will, in nine cases out of ten, realize more profit by
merely making his trade in the stock and going about his business until
he considers it wise to terminate the contract. I will say decidedly
that more traders will do better, make more money, and suffer less loss
of time, and less annoyance by abandoning scalping tactics altogether.</p>

<p>“This view will no doubt cause my friends in the brokerage business
much wrath and indignation. They naturally prefer to have ten
commissions rather than one, and I fear that in many cases they
recommend scalping tactics for no better reason than the one mentioned.</p>

<p>“That constant and repeated operations are disastrous, is pretty well
shown by the remark of a successful ‘Bucket-Shop’ man: ‘I don’t care
what they do, or what the market does, if I can only keep them coming
up to the order windows every few hours,’ said this gentleman. And he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
was right; for the ordinary scalper is no more than a gambler, basing
his operations on possible variations, and paying a great percentage.</p>

<p>“But if one will insist on scalping, it may be well to examine the
subject from the other side and see how the least of the evils may be
chosen. Without recommending the practice, or qualifying the views
expressed above, I will therefore give my idea of the safest methods of
scalping.</p>

<p>“The man who attempts to operate on both sides of the market during the
same period, is the most deluded individual in the speculative world. I
have already stated, that I have only seen two traders out of thousands
I have observed, who could do this with any degree of success. These
hybrid Bull-bears are certainly not working on any definitely formed
opinion of the future. They are worse off than even the traders who are
unchangeably and constitutionally wedded to one side of the market the
year round. These latter prejudiced and inflexible individuals will
occasionally have a turn in their direction, whatever their position
may be, but the Bull-bear will go from one month to another, never
seeing anything more than a temporary gain.</p>

<p>“It is important, therefore, that the active trader should form his
ideas, base his views on something, and, if he wishes to entertain
himself with repeated operations, map out a plan of campaign which
shall be, at least, intelligent in its original conception.</p>

<p>“Just how successfully the plan suggested will result, depends largely
upon the alertness and understanding of the individual who engineers
it. If the active participant is easily moved from his position by
changes of a point or two against him; if he is easily frightened by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
wild rumors and inspired talk; if he expects to gain thousands in a
few days by venturing hundreds; or if he believes that he can operate
in stocks so shrewdly as to guess high or low points within a dollar
or two a share, he will meet with disappointment and loss. If he can
overcome these drawbacks, he may do very well as an active trader, but
I wish to reiterate my views that the man who takes a position on the
market and retains it, will make more money than the scalper.</p>

<p>“As a test question, let me put this inquiry to the active traders who
read this letter:</p>

<p>“When you have been correct on a certain movement of say ten points,
and have made repeated operations, did you make any more money, or as
much, as you would have realized on a single trade showing a ten point
profit?”—From Thomas Gibson’s Market Letter, February 14th, 1907.</p>

<h3 id="CROP"><i>Crop Damage.</i></h3>

<p>As to the crops, we find many over-optimistic people trying to belittle
positive crop damage. It cannot be belittled. It is dangerous and
foolish to evade an issue instead of facing it. The argument that our
surplus from last year will carry us through a shortage is puerile.
That surplus has already been considered. Wheat in the bin is money;
some of that money has already been spent and all of it has been given
due consideration in the basing of our wealth. A number of writers
attempt to make a probable crop of 2,500,000,000 bushels of corn a
“bumper crop.” Their methods of arriving at this conclusion are not
sound. It is certain that we should, in the natural course of events,
raise more and more wheat and corn each year as the population of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
world, and the uses of the cereals increase. To compare one year with
another will not do. Particularly in Corn and Cotton must we steadily
increase in acreage and production, for we supply the world with those
commodities. To illustrate this point, let us go back a few years and
see what has occurred.</p>

<p>The time is very near at hand, when anything less than 3,000,000,000
bushels of corn will be a crop failure; and high prices cannot be
considered a great compensation in lean years. Short crops mean
decreased demand for labor and loss of purchasing power by the common
people, who are after all the best spenders.—From Thomas Gibson’s
Market Letter, July 13th, 1907.</p>

<h3 id="SELECT"><i>The Selection of Securities.</i></h3>

<p>When so many seductive baits are offered, so many nets and traps
contrived and constructed by clever brains and cunning fingers are
spread for the capture of those having money, is it surprising that the
careless and credulous are victimized, and even that the sagacious and
prudent should sometimes be taken in? Nevertheless, for the losses they
have sustained, investors, as a rule, have themselves chiefly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
blame. The mistakes made, in nine cases out of ten, have been the
purchase of “cheap” securities. The hope of realizing a little more
than ordinary interest, by buying paper at a discount, has proved to
be the rock on which unnumbered capitalists have split. In addition to
their money’s worth, they have endeavored to get something for nothing,
with the result of most generally getting nothing for something. It
is remarkable how blind are people, ordinarily sagacious enough to
make money, to the fact that property cannot pay a revenue beyond its
producing capacity. For instance, how can a trolley company, whose line
is wholly or mainly built from the proceeds of mortgage bonds, sell
them at a heavy discount, besides allowing large commissions for the
selling, and then pay both this interest and dividends on a large issue
of watered stocks? Or how can a poor agriculturist, occupying a half
improved farm out on the frontier, with a family to support and grain
selling barely above the cost of production, pay ten or twelve per
cent. upon the capital with which he does business?—From “The Art of
Wall Street Investing,” by John Moody.</p>

<h3 id="BANK"><i>The Bank Statement.</i></h3>

<p>“A statement or exhibit of the condition of banks.</p>

<p>“In New York the Bank Statement is issued from the clearing house
on Saturday. The consolidated statement (or as it is officially
designated, the “summary of the weekly statement of the associated
banks”) is the collective showing by the banks belonging to the
clearing house—the showing when the returns of the individual banks
have been consolidated (put together).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“The consolidated bank statement shows the average deposits, loans,
specie, legal tenders, circulation, reserve and surplus reserve of the
banks for the week ending with and including Friday.</p>

<p>“The term deposits includes the net deposits (credit balances) of
persons and concerns (designated as individual deposits), balances
to the credit of other banks and all money and credits subject to
withdrawal. Loans include money loaned and likewise paper (promissory
notes, drafts, etc.) bought. Specie includes not only gold and silver
coins, but also gold certificates, which are redeemable in gold or
silver, as the case may be. Legal tenders as the term is used in the
bank statement, means, United States notes (greenbacks) and Treasury
notes (notes issued for silver bullion purchased under the so-called
Sherman act).</p>

<p>“Note.—As defined by the statutes, legal tenders include United States
notes, Treasury notes, gold and silver coins and minor coins, but not
gold certificates, nor silver certificates.</p>

<p>“Circulation means the notes issued by national banks, to secure the
redemption of which Government bonds have to be purchased by the banks
and deposited with the Treasurer of the United States. A bank cannot
count circulation in its reserve; whether it is its own circulation or
the circulation of some other bank, makes no difference. Reserve means
the total amount of specie and legal tenders held. Surplus reserve
means the total amount held in excess of legal requirement. A national
bank (in New York City) must, by law, maintain a reserve equal to
25 per cent. of its deposits; a state bank must, by law, maintain a
reserve of 15 per cent. In compiling the bank statement a reserve of 25
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
per cent. is allowed or figured for state banks as well as for national
banks.</p>

<p>“The detailed bank statement, which is issued simultaneously with the
consolidated statement, contains first the number of each bank (each
bank has a number by which it is known at the clearing house) and then
the name of the bank, after which follow the amounts of its capital,
net profits (surplus and undivided profits), specie, legal tenders,
deposits and circulation.</p>

<p>“The bank statement is said to have been made up on rising averages
when the items in it have been increasing in amount during the week, or
the statement is said to have been made up on falling averages when the
items in it have been decreasing in amount during the week.</p>

<p>“Generally speaking, the bank statement is favorable or good when it
shows that the position of the banks has been strengthened, as by an
increase in the surplus reserve through, or by means of an increase in
their cash holdings rather than by a decrease in their deposits, which
often is effected by the calling of loans—by demanding and obtaining
the payment of money loaned on call. As money loaned is credited to
borrowers on their deposit accounts and increases the total deposits of
the bank, so the payment of loans by borrowers takes from and decreases
deposits. As will be seen, the calling and consequent payment of loans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
does not increase cash holdings but merely changes balances in
individual accounts. A reduction in deposits reduces the amount of cash
required to be held as a legal reserve and correspondingly expands
(increases) the surplus reserve. Generally speaking, also, the bank
statement is unfavorable or, if particularly unfavorable, is bad when
the position of the banks has been weakened, as by a decrease in the
surplus reserve through a decrease in their cash holdings rather
than by an increase in their deposits, which often is effected by an
expansion in (increase in amount of) their loans, which correspondingly
expands (increases) their deposits and correspondingly increases the
amount of cash required to be held as a legal reserve. This additional
amount is deducted from and correspondingly reduces the surplus reserve.</p>

<p>“The bank statement may be said to be favorable or good, however, if
an increase in loans is reported when the banks are surfeited with
money: also the bank statement may be said to be unfavorable or rather
not good (but hardly bad) when it shows that money is accumulating in
idleness in the banks—when deposits are increasing, not as a result of
increasing loans, but in the absence of a borrowing demand for money.</p>

<p>“There are other circumstances which make the bank statement favorable
or unfavorable as disclosed in the circumstances themselves.</p>

<p>“There is also a non-member bank statement, which is a statement of the
conditions of banks which are not members of the clearing house but
clear through members. This statement is issued from the clearing house
on Monday and shows the average condition of the banks for the week
ending with and including the preceding Friday.

by its capital, net profits, average amount of loans and discounts and
investments, average amount of specie, average amount of legal tender
notes and (national) bank notes, average amount on deposit with its
clearing house agent (the bank through which it clears at the clearing

<h3 id="STOCK"><i>The Cycles of Stock Speculation.</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h3>
</div>

<p>All speculators, and most investors, possess a general idea of the
range and trend of prices for a considerable period. This knowledge is
more frequently based upon impressions gained during their own years
of activity in the speculative world than upon research. The knowledge
gained by active participation is certainly the most forcible and
lasting, but is frequently productive of erroneous ideas, as will be
set forth hereafter.</p>

<p>For the purpose of giving a clear idea of the movements in stocks
during recent years, the accompanying chart has been arranged. The
use of circles in lieu of the customary straight lines was hit upon
as presenting more clearly to the eye the comparative extent of each
year’s movement, and more plainly distinguishing one year from another.
These advantages are gained without obscuring from view the general
trend of prices for the period considered.</p>

<p>For the purpose of establishing a single hypothetical stock whose
movements should be representative of the course of all other active
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
securities, the fluctuations of twenty stocks were welded together.
That is to say, the high points of these stocks for the year 1896
were added and divided by 20. The same course was followed with the
low points, and each year considered was treated in like manner. By
drawing a circle upon a numbered chart with the upper rim resting
upon the figures representing the high point, and the lower rim upon
those representing the low point, an average price for the year is
necessarily established at the axis.</p>

<p>The size of the circles shows the actual and comparative extent of the
movements, and the position of consecutive years on the diagram shows
the general trend of prices.</p>

<p>In selecting the twenty stocks to be used in forming a composite
security, care was taken to eliminate the shares of such corporations
as have undergone radical changes during the period considered, 1896
to 1905, inclusive. The Rock Island Company, for example, is in itself
an important system, but owing to the conversion of $75,000,000 Common
stock into $200,000,000 of mixed securities in 1902, the tracing of
its subsequent movements would involve unnecessary computations and
explanations. It may be added that experimental tests show that the
hypothetical stock, call it “Composite Common” for the sake of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
convenient reference, was faithfully representative of almost all
movements from 1896 to 1906, and that the selection of other stocks
would have made only insignificant variations in the general result.
The original intention was to extend the investigation for a longer
period than ten years, but so many readjustments, assessments, and
other changes occurred in listed securities prior to 1896 as to make a
clear showing difficult.</p>

<p>Common stocks of railroads only were considered. Few Industrials have
reached their tenth birthday, and aside from this, their introduction
would make a false showing by increasing the dividend rate with no
corresponding increase in the selling price of the stock.</p>

<p>The twenty stocks chosen for amalgamation were as follows:</p>

<p>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, Baltimore and Ohio, Canadian Pacific,
Canada Southern, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, Chicago &amp; Great Western, Chicago,
Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul, Chicago &amp; Northwestern, Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, Erie, Illinois Central, Louisville &amp; Nashville,
Missouri Pacific, New York Central &amp; Hudson River RR., Pennsylvania,
Reading, Southern Pacific, Southern Railway, Union Pacific, and Wabash RR.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
It has been the frequent contention of the writer that a chart as a
basis for speculative ventures is ridiculous, but a diagram framed for
the purpose of pointing out certain facts, or inciting the student of
speculative affairs to investigation of causes is a different matter.
No interested person can look at the accompanying chart without being
struck at once with the decline of 1903 following the steady advance
of the preceding years. If this observation incites intelligent
investigations as to the reasons for the reversal, much good may
result. On the other hand, the fallacy of operating on mere mechanical
records of the past is shown by the same diagram. If the chart had
been handed to one of the mechanical traders in 1902 he would have
argued that the average price of each year marked the approximate low
point of each succeeding year. It certainly does look convincing,
but what follows? The infallible system not only fails to work, but
reverses itself, and the average price of 1902 becomes the approximate
high price of 1903 and 1904. At about the time the system player has
gathered enough figures to go on, a change occurs. No intrinsic merit
attaches to any kind of diagram, they being merely convenient forms for
tabulating history.</p>

<p>Some interesting coincidences occur in the chart; most remarkable is
the exactly similar size and position of the circles representing the
years 1901 and 1903. In no instance did the high or low points of any
integral stock correspond in these years, but the total footings were
identical in each case.</p>

<p>The speculator may extract some value from the diagram by observing
that opportunities for profits of forty or fifty points did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
occur during the entire period. The extreme possibilities in any one
year were 33 points, and much less on the average. If the trader had
purchased or sold Composite at an average price, his possibilities of
profit would have been limited to about 15 points in any one year. This
does not accord with accepted theories. The ordinary speculator who
pursues his operations for ten or fifteen points successfully is almost
certain to believe that much more profit lies before him, that he is
only getting started. There is a reason for this; the public trader
takes for his barometer some security which has been conspicuous for
its extended fluctuations; he naturally notices and remembers it to the
exclusion of the rank and file of stocks. For example, every active
participant in speculative affairs knows that Copper had a range of
75 points in a single year, 1901. He bases possibilities too much on
this sort of knowledge without reflecting that Copper was a cardinal
exception, and that in order to participate in such movements he must throw
caution to the winds, and deal in stocks which offer no degree of safety.</p>

<p>Another point established is the lapse of time required in a
readjustment of values. It took Composite Common seven years to advance
from an average price of 37 to an average price of 105, 68 points. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
again falls short of the speculator’s ideas. He expects to buy a stock
at 50 today, and sell it at par six months hence, an operation which is
shown by the movements of a representative stock to require a period of
six years. Again his expectations are founded on exceptions. The same
line of reasoning applies to one case as to the other. The speculator
unconsciously magnifies everything connected with speculation.</p>

<p>In reviewing the movements of prices from 1896 to 1905, the most
important question is, what caused the reversal of form in 1903? A
complete answer to this question would be highly educational. There
was no panic, nothing faintly resembling one; business suffered
some stagnation, it is true; there was a falling off in the iron
and steel business, but crops were good, and wheat, corn, oats, and
cotton brought good prices in both 1903 and 1904. Serious business
depression was more in anticipation than in realization, but 1904
witnessed no material recovery in prices. These causes do not fully
explain so radical a change. If conditions had been such as to cause
a reduction of dividends, or a scarcity of money in 1903, the decline
would be explained, but money was plentiful enough, and dividends were
unchanged. The ratio of dividends as compared with prices was also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
fairly maintained from 1896 to 1902, and it would appear that prices
should merely stop advancing when dividends became stationary; but
prices did not merely stand still, they went materially backward.</p>

<p>Without pretending to enter into a full discussion of the causes for
the change, one or two points may assist in forming a conclusion. The
steady advance in prices from 1896 to 1902 represented two things—a
recovery from the great depression of 1893, and the natural advances
of property values in a prosperous and growing country. The latter
point is the more important, and as there has been no cessation of the
growth of population or prosperity, other causes for the reversion
must be sought. It is not sufficient to merely say that the recovery
over-leaped itself, for such an event would have plainly mirrored
itself in a reduction in the rate of dividend returns.</p>

<p>Capitalization of railroads in 1903 increased about 14% as compared
with an average increase of 6% in the preceding seven years. Add to
this the tremendous increase in the capitalization of industrial
corporations, and an over-supply of stocks appears as one of the
contributary causes—undigested securities.</p>

<p>Dividend rates were maintained, but were not increased. This
particularly affects the simon pure speculator. Nothing will drive him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
into a panic quicker than a decreased dividend, and nothing makes him
so sanguine of higher prices as an increase in the rate of payment. He
is always basing his operations on rumors of higher dividends, and when
one of these rumors fails of verification, it is almost as bad as a decrease.</p>

<p>And dividends did decrease in one important quarter; United States
Steel, the speculative favorite, capitalized more heavily than a
dozen ordinary corporations, cut its rate from 4 to 3½%, with every
promise of a further reduction. This had a far reaching effect, both on
speculators and small investors.</p>

<p>It is certain that fundamental conditions have more to do in shaping
prices than has speculation, but the speculator helps, and in 1903
he was particularly potent because of the excesses engendered by the
unusual speculative advances of 1901 and 1902. He helped to make the
prices and he helped to break them, so he may be considered a factor in
the reversal.</p>

<p>The small investor helped. He, too, is a dividend man; he seldom looks
at earnings, improvements, or extensions—he wants dividends. United
States Steel was a body blow to him; it not only affected his purse,
but it frightened him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>And it is probable that an army of small investors sold their holdings
for another reason—they discovered that they could make a higher rate
of income in other channels. So long as both dividends and prices
advanced they were satisfied. They were speculating, not investing, but
you cannot convince the ordinary man that buying a stock outright, in
the hope of an advance in price, is speculation pure and simple.</p>

<p>Much of the money diverted from the stock market in 1903 by the class
last mentioned, has never returned to Wall Street. This bears out
the theory that higher rates of interest are being found elsewhere.
Never before has the public refused to enter the stock market during
a period of great prosperity. They are absent now, and furthermore,
they show no intention of returning. Possibly they are wrong. The same
influences which are operating to give them better returns may be
operating to greatly enhance the value of the shares they ignore,—but
the small investors want dividends. Their failure to enter the stock
market would seem to be strong evidence that they are finding other
investment-speculations more attractive than listed shares. If this is
the case, the influences leading to higher interest rates are already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
at work, although not clearly discernible. Diversification of
investments would tend to obscure the truth for a time.</p>

<p>But whatever the causes for the stock market relapse of 1903 may have
been, the recovery has been complete. The average prices of 1906 were
the highest on record.

<p>In examining the price movements of wheat and corn for the last ten
years, a gradually advancing trend is apparent. That such would be the
case was a foregone conclusion; we naturally expect to find wheat and
corn in the foremost ranks of a universal movement towards higher
prices. The underlying causes for this general appreciation have
already been extensively and clearly discussed in Moody’s Magazine.</p>

<p class="center"><i>All Prices Advancing.</i></p>

<p>The price appreciation of wheat and corn is merely confirmatory of
the theory that all prices are advancing, and that they will continue
to advance until the balance between gold and other commodities is
readjusted.</p>

<p>But there is something else written between the lines of the statistics
of price changes in wheat and corn. The <i>relative</i> advance of the
two cereals is all out of proportion.</p>

<p>This fact leads us to seek for some specific cause operating either to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
depress one cereal or enhance the other, irrespective of the influence
already named.</p>

<p>The average price of wheat in the first year (1896) was 73 ¹¹/₁₆ in
standard format, in the two following years very high prices were
established, and the average may be considered abnormal, as the years
1897 and 1898 cover the rise and fall of Joseph Leiter.

To digress for a moment, it may be interesting to note that efforts
to carry prices beyond reasonable limits almost invariably result in
disaster to the promoters, no matter how far they may be successful
in establishing black-board quotations. With the exception of “Old
Hutch” wheat corner in 1888, all the numerous attempts to speculate
successfully on wholly artificial prices in commodities, have failed.
The Sully cotton campaign, the Leiter wheat deal, the Phillips corn
deal, the Coster-Martin corn deal, all ended in ruin for their sponsors.</p>

<p>From 1899 to 1901 inclusive, the average price of wheat was a little
above 70 cents, in 1902 and 1903 it rose to 80 cents, and in 1904 and
1905 to $1.00.</p>

<p>In the latter years, allowance must again be made for unusual
influences, the Russo-Japanese war naturally helping wheat prices;
making due allowance for this, it may be fairly considered that wheat
has in the last ten years increased its average selling price from
about 70 cents to 90 cents, or approximately 30%.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Why Corn Has Risen More Than Wheat.</i></p>

<p>Corn prices in the same period have advanced 100%; the comparatively
large number of uses to which corn is put may partly account for the
disproportionate enhancement of its price, but the discrepancy is too
great to be entirely explained away on this account. It is necessary to
seek some additional and more powerful reason.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
The following statistical facts will make it clear that corn and wheat
are in wholly different positions.</p>

<p>The United States raised, in 1905, 693,000,000 bushels of wheat.
The world’s wheat crop in the same year was 3,275,200,000 bushels.
Therefore, we raised approximately 21% of the world’s wheat crop. The
year 1905 is fairly indicative of the proportions for the last ten
years.</p>

<p>The acreage of wheat in the United States in 1896 was 43,618,646; in
1905 it was 47,854,079, an increase of 38%.</p>

<p>The world’s wheat acreage as indicated by production, is increasing at
about the same rate as is the acreage of the United States.</p>

<p>The United States raised, in 1905, 2,708,000,000 bushels of corn. The
world’s corn crop was 3,396,800,000; therefore, we raised 80% of the
world’s corn.</p>

<p>The corn acreage of the United States in 1896 was 81,027,156; in 1905
it was 94,011,369, an increase of 16%. The world’s corn acreage, as
shown by production, did not keep pace with our own ratio of increase,
but remained almost stationary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>These figures show that the world is depending on the United States
for only 21% of its wheat, and that wheat acreage the world over has
increased about 38% in ten years; but the world is depending on the
United States for 80% of its corn, and the world’s corn acreage has
increased less than 16%.</p>

<p>In order to grasp the full significance of these figures, our practical
monopoly of corn production must be appreciated. Even if we admit an
equal ratio of increase in corn acreage the world over, it remains for
the United States to provide 80% of the increase.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Corn Area Limited.</i></p>

<p>The probability of any considerable area of new corn land being
exploited, either at home or abroad, is very small. A recent circular
letter by a man prominent in the cash corn trade, states that there is
not an uncultivated acre of available corn land in the United States.
This is a radical statement, and does not allow for the fact that with
a sufficient price stimulus, considerable wheat, or even cotton land,
would be diverted to corn. But whatever allowances are made for an
increased corn production, it must be admitted that the possibilities
are largely confined to the United States.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Wheat acreage is not thus circumscribed; in fact, the case is
practically reversed; almost 80% of the natural increase in wheat
production will come from outside our boundaries. Of the principal
wheat producing countries,—France, Germany, Russia, Poland and
Caucasus, Italy, Hungary, Spain, Roumania and Argentine Republic—the
two first named alone fail to keep pace with the United States in ratio
of increased production, and others have made up the deficit of these
two laggards.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the difference between the relative positions of wheat
and corn is this: The world’s supply of wheat will be furnished by the
world, while the world’s supply of corn must be furnished by the United
States.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that while wheat and corn may both be expected
to gradually seek a higher average price in sympathy with the general
upward trend, corn is affected by a specific influence, the effects of
which must be added to the homogeneous advance.</p>

<p>It is not possible that the supply of corn should increase as rapidly
as the demand, under the circumscribed conditions herein set forth. As
has already been suggested, the price of corn may become attractive
enough to cause the diversion of wheat and cotton lands to corn
growing. The possibilities of such a course, however, are not only
limited by nature, but such action would stop itself at a certain point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
by decreasing the supply of wheat or cotton, and again restoring them
to favor with the planter.</p>

<p>The speculator may, therefore, reasonably believe that corn is
destined, eventually, to reach much higher prices. He must, of course,
allow for the temporary influences of large and small crops, and the
numerous other actual and technical conditions which cause intermediate
fluctuations, and must furthermore bear steadily in mind the fact that
there is a limit beyond which the price of corn can never be sustained.</p>

<p>When a given commodity goes beyond a price where it can be replaced by
another commodity, it has gone too far; and when necessities become
luxuries, they take their places as such, and demand slackens.

<p>The accompanying chart, formed on the same plan as the diagram
illustrating the movements of stocks in Moody’s Magazine for May,
develops some interesting features in the movements of Cotton for the
last ten years.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those readers who did not follow the stock chart, it
may be said that each circle represents the fluctuations for a single
year. The bottom rim of the circle rests on the lowest price during the
period, and the top rim on the highest price. The average price is, of
course, established at the axis.</p>

<p>The chart illustrates speculative extremes in cotton, the figures on
which it is based are not the prices of Spot cotton, but extreme high
or low prices for all options. The result, however, would have been
only slightly changed had Spot cotton prices been employed.</p>

<p>The diagram is based on fluctuations of 25 points, or ¼ cent per
pound; the prices shown, therefore, are not exact, but they serve to
illustrate comparative movements with sufficient accuracy. The high and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
low figures are not those of a calendar year, but of a fiscal, or crop
year, ending August 31 of the years named; thus the prices for 1896
represent the fluctuations of the season 1896-1897. As production is
necessarily a vital factor in making prices, this method was adopted to
prevent confusion in examining the price effects of lean or abundant
production. The range of prices for the period considered (1896 to 1906
inclusive), was as follows:</p>

<p>In the first three years considered we find low prices, and naturally
restricted speculation. The speculative price range for the entire
three year period is only a shade more than 3½ cents per pound. This
was occasioned by two things; first, the general depression following
the panic of 1893, and second, over-production. An examination of the
prices of staples shows that unusually low figures prevailed in 1898 and
1899. Corn, for example, averaged 27 cents in 1897, and 31½ cents in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
1898. Wheat shows high average prices, but the showing is a result of
fictitious speculative figures established by the Leiter deal, and
cannot be considered a fair criterion. It may be added, however, that
wheat sold as low as 64 cents in 1897, and 62 cents in 1898.</p>

<p>The question of over-production will be made apparent by reference to

<p>Prior to 1897 no crop of over 10,000,000 bales had ever been made;
the two bumper crops, 1897-98 and 1898-99 coming together, naturally
brought about very low prices, particularly as they occurred in a
period of general depression.</p>

<p>In the season next following, 1899-1900, there is a marked falling off
in production, which is again reflected in a higher average price. But
from that time on, we do not find prices and production in such perfect accord.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>It is generally considered now that 10,500,000 bales is a fair crop. In
the four seasons from 1900-01 to 1903-04 inclusive, we raised normal
crops, while prices advanced. It would be manifestly unfair to consider
the year 1903-04 as reflecting with any degree of accuracy the normal
price of cotton, for in that period occurred the disastrous Sully
campaign. Making due allowance for this, however, it may be assumed
that prices would have advanced if no such deal had occurred. This
statement is supported by the fact that the bursting of the bubble did
not put prices below 9 cents at any time.</p>

<p>Now the most important part of the period is reached, the seasons of
1904-05 and 1905-06.</p>

<p>In 1904-05, in the face of an unprecedented crop of 13,600,000 bales,
and in spite of the depressing influence of a speculative debauch in
the previous year, the average price of cotton was 8¾ cents.</p>

<p>Still later, in 1905-06, a crop only a little below normal was raised
and sold at an average price of 10.93.</p>

<p>Eliminating speculative extremes, and the temporary effects of large or
small crops, it appears that the price of cotton is steadily advancing.
This is the principal fact for the speculator to consider.</p>

<p>No one pretends to dispute the fact that the prices of all staple-food
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
stuffs, metals and other commodities, as well as labor, have advanced
materially in the last ten years. Yet the ordinary speculator ignores
this broad general principle, and seeks specific causes for the
readjustment in cotton prices. And even this research is seldom
conducted intelligently. The investigator attempts to explain higher
cotton prices by pointing to reduction of acreage, diversification of
crops and organizations formed for the purpose of withholding supplies
from the market. He disregards the fact that while these influences
play some small part in the matter, cotton is also seeking a higher
level in common with every commodity that is bought and sold.</p>

<p>The contention is frequently heard that 10,500,000 bales, or even
11,000,000 bales of cotton can no longer be considered an average crop;
that the supply should steadily increase in order to keep pace with
consumptive demand, and that the crop of 1904-05 was therefore small,
and the crop of 1903-04 not so large as it would appear. As this is the
most common of the numerous explanations offered as to the recent high
prices of cotton, it will be briefly discussed.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a clear view of the ratio of increase in
production, a considerable period must be consulted. The statistics of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
crops from year to year, or even from two or three years, will not do.
Let us cover a long period, jumping ten years at a time.</p>

<p>This exhibit shows that if a sufficiently long period is consulted,
a steady increase in production is shown; the average production is
also well maintained in the five years from 1901-02 to 1905-06, if the
bumper crop of 1904-05 is distributed over the entire period.</p>

<p>The contention is all right, but its formulators do not take the pains
to ascertain that what they claim <i>should</i> occur, is exactly what
<i>has</i> occurred.</p>

<p>The gist of the whole matter is this: regardless of all temporary or
artificial influences, some powerful force, not related to supply and
demand, is shouldering prices steadily upward.</p>

<p>To the speculator this fact recognized, analyzed, and properly applied
should be of incalculable benefit. If he understands <i>why</i> prices
have been advancing, he will be able to determine with facility how
long the influence will probably endure. Instead of being misled, or
rendered over-cautious by obsolete records of the past, he will be able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
to calculate from these obsolete records the reasonable expectations of
the future. Temporary changes will, of course, be brought about by
temporary causes. Fundamental values will still be influenced by supply
and demand, but if an independent and submerged force is also at work,
due allowance must be made for its operation.</p>

<p>That such a force <i>is</i> at work is written large between the lines
of compiled statistics; to ignore its existence is an error rank with
mischief. The speculator who does not consult this influence may easily
make the mistake of selling at low prices because they are high by
comparison with prices which obtained a few years ago.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a clear understanding of the matter will enable the
trader to decide with more or less accuracy what now constitutes a low
price for cotton, and what will be the probable price for the future.

<h3><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>The questions most frequently asked by inexperienced people are as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1—What margins are necessary to reasonable safety?</p>
<p class="neg-indent">2—Is it better to study the entire list or make a
        specialty of one stock?</p>
<p class="neg-indent">3—What class of securities is the safest?</p>
<p class="neg-indent">4—What may be considered a fair rally or reaction in
          stock prices under ordinary circumstances?</p>
<p class="neg-indent">5—What is the best general method of trading?</p>
</div>

<p>Some of these questions have been answered in the preceding chapters,
but they will be taken up here in turn and the writer’s views submitted
on each head.</p>

<p>1—What margins are necessary to reasonable safety?</p>

<p>There is no unqualified answer to this question. The price of the
shares operated in must be considered. All other things being equal,
a stock selling at $50 would require only half the margin employed in
operating in a security selling at $100. If the $50 stock declines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
25 points, it has suffered a quoted loss of half its value. The $100
stock, however, must decline 50 points to suffer an equal loss. This
percentage of advance or decline is established with remarkable
fidelity in every considerable movement.</p>

<p>If the scale order is employed as a method of accumulating shares,
extraordinary marginal provisions must be made, for even as the line
acquired increases, the original margin dwindles. The scale order
is, or should be, based on the assumption that a temporary decline
below the first purchase price is desirable and is necessary to the
best results. This fact, however, should never be contorted in such a
manner as to instigate purchases at high prices. If the operator who
employs the scale order will try to make the first purchase at what
he considers a bargain price, or in other words at what he calculates
to be the very bottom of a movement, he will surely find that in nine
cases out of ten, his own errors or the velocity which frequently
carries prices to ridiculously low or high points will enable him to
accumulate his line to advantage. The scale order should never be used
on its mechanical merits alone, but merely as a method of averaging.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that marginal necessities will be principally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
gauged by the correctness of the speculator’s general views. It is the
writer’s opinion, that if care and intelligence is used in judging
values, conditions, and the stages of the market, a margin of 20% will
be sufficient in almost all cases. That is to say, 20 points on a
stock selling at par and 10 points on a stock selling at 50. It must
be distinctly understood, however, that this opinion contemplates
purchases at low prices after a decline has occurred; and when both the
technical and general conditions warrant purchases.</p>

<p>The late Charles H. Dow fixed the sum of $2,500 as the minimum amount
necessary to safe operating in ten share lots, but this sum, or any
other for that matter, is an arbitrary estimate. Mr. Dow’s figure was
founded on the necessity of averaging and also upon a most laudable
caution and conservatism which, however, might at times result in
unnecessary restriction of operations at a most favorable period.
There are times when $500 might be safely made the basis of trading in
certain stocks; there are other times and other stocks where $2,500
would be wholly insufficient.</p>

<p>While no rule of thumb is possible in this regard, it is the writer’s
opinion that there is no necessity for being out in calculations more
than 20%, provided always that due care has been exercised in basing
such calculations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>2—Is it better to study the entire list or make a specialty of one
security?</p>

<p>It is better to examine the conditions and prices of all the leading
securities. This is the only method by which <i>comparative</i> values
may be arrived at. It is frequently the case, particularly after
a comprehensive decline or a panic, that certain excellent shares
have suffered almost as much as the more questionable securities.
At such times, what we want is not only a good bargain but the best
bargain obtainable, and this may be secured more readily by a careful
comparison of prices, values and income return than by any other method.</p>

<p>Again, in an upward movement stocks generally advance, not
homogeneously, but one at a time or in closely related groups. Certain
shares may have a reasonable advance while others hang fire. If we have
good reason to believe we are on the eve of a great bull movement, the
best results may be attained by a process of rotation in trading.</p>

<p>3—What class of securities is the safest?</p>

<p>Railroad stocks are the soundest securities. The danger of competition
is not so great; the assets are more tangible and when once the
specific influences which are now working against them have been cured
or eliminated, as they certainly will be in time, these shares will
show a steady improvement both in value and price. At times the very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
best stock will suffer severely and much pessimistic talk will be
heard of receiverships, etc. That is the time to buy. Lord Rothschild
once advised a friend to buy French rentes. “But the streets of Paris
are running with blood,” replied the recipient of the advice. “That,”
responded Rothschild, “is the reason you can buy rentes so cheaply.”
The man who purchases the shares of railroads when they are greatly
depressed may rest serenely in the consciousness that the future of
American railroads is assured and that measures seeking to obstruct
progress or prevent fair returns on investments, either in the way of
income on money or the natural accretion of values cannot possibly endure.</p>

<p>4—What may be considered a fair rally or reaction in stock prices?</p>

<p>Here again the question of ruling prices of a certain stock are to be
considered. Low-priced stocks always move in a narrower range than do
higher priced ones. The extent of a probable comparative movement may
be gauged by percentages with a fair degree of accuracy. This method of
measuring a comparative advance or decline, however, will be frequently
disturbed by specific influences bearing on a certain stock or group of stocks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>It is useless to undertake to establish even a rough rule for ordinary
movements by a system of averages culled from history. We find that in
the course of ten years the rallies and reactions which appeared were
so varied in character both as to the extent in points and the duration
in days, that a barometrical average founded on such investigation
would be empirical. However, the results of this inductive reasoning
will be given for what they are worth.</p>

<p>The principal movements for ten years have been as follows:</p>

<p class="f110"><b><i>1.—The Bull Market of 1897 to 1899.</i></b></p>

<p>This advance began in April, 1897, and terminated in April, 1899—two
years of advancing prices. The average advance in Industrial shares was
38.79 points, or about 100%. Railroads advanced 38.92 points, or about 80%.</p>

<p>The year 1906 was a neutral year. Prices for Industrials declined only
slightly during the year and average prices of railroad stocks were the
same in December as in January. Money could have been made throughout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the period, either by sales on rallies, or purchases on declines. As a
consideration of a neutral year would add little to this exhibit, it
will be omitted.</p>

<p>5.—What is the best general method of trading?</p>

<p>The writer’s reply to this question consists principally of a summing
up of points already covered in other portions of this work. It is
necessary to study and understand the subject thoroughly, to know
values, general conditions, the technical position of shares, and
above all things to consult future probabilities rather than past
performances. Study of the past has its educational value and this is
also true of the present, but the future is the all-important thing.
Retrospective speculation is one of the commonest and most flagrant
of the numerous errors made by public participators. Get whatever of
experience and information you can from history, but <i>speculate</i>
on the <i>future</i>.</p>

<p>The man who enters the market with insufficient capital, who expects
to get rich quick or who allows success to lead him into excesses and
over-speculation will lose. It is as certain as death. He may succeed
for a time but not for long.</p>

<p>Operations based on “tips” or “charts” will lead to final disaster.
This thing of trying to attribute habits to a market is, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
writer’s opinion, ridiculous. The movements of prices are caused
by events. We know that in periods of financial stringency or
business depression prices fall, and in periods of inflation and
good times prices rise. It is possible to formulate a system founded
on repetitions applicable to every game of chance, and laid out on
paper, that system will appear infallible. You can find the exponents
of machine-made riches in every pool-room and gambling house in the
country. They all eventually lose and there is nothing to show that
the advocates of charts as a basis for stock trading ever fared any
better. Imagine James R. Keene, or J. P. Morgan poring over a chart and
operating thereon. Even if the market did have habits, as soon as these
habits were recognized and followed by a sufficient number of people,
the technical position would be rendered so rotten that the charts
would fail from that influence alone. Charts, employed as a convenient
method of picturing the past, may have a certain value, but used as
a basis for trading they are an evidence of laziness or incapacity,
or both. It requires hard work to be successful in any line. Thinking
is hard work, study is hard work, research is hard work; and it is
infinitely easier to bet on repetitions all nicely laid out in crooked
lines on a sheet of paper than to laboriously erect sound deductions;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
but the difference in the two methods is that one will succeed and the
other will fail.</p>

<p>We may also resort to the ultimatum employed by those eminent
citizens who punch each other’s noses in a prize-ring, i.e., tell the
chart-players to “go and get a reputation.” When they can show even one
instance of a fortune accumulated by this method their cause will be
greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>In the exception taken to Mr. Dow’s theory of $2,500 being the minimum
amount necessary for operations in small lots, nothing could be further
from the present writer’s intentions than to recommend transactions on
insufficient margin. What is sought is merely the truth. The contention
that it is wise to stimulate extreme conservatism will not hold. If the
naming of a certain sum far in excess of real needs is praiseworthy, we
may expand the matter indefinitely and name $5,000 or even $10,000, as
the limit.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, errors on the side of prudence are vastly
preferable to errors on the side of rashness. In this as in all other
things, the golden mean is the really desirable factor.</p>

<p>As to the best side of the market for operations, it is thought that
the long side offers the greatest opportunities. The long side is
healthier, it is constructive, and almost all the great fortunes made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
in the market have been founded on discreet and well-timed purchases.
To adhere to this plan, however, frequently requires long periods of
non-participation, and speculators are not, as a class, very patient.
The man who can so school himself as to await opportunities to purchase
good securities at low prices has by far the best of the bargain. Few
men can do it.</p>

<p>It is fully realized that a work which defends stock speculation in any
degree, will meet with much criticism. Nevertheless, people <i>will</i>
speculate and if you are one of those who will—do it right.</p>

<p>It is submitted in concluding this work that if the advice here given
is heeded, i. e., to know <i>what</i> you are buying and <i>why</i>;
to buy only <i>good</i> properties when prices are depressed; to
exercise patience and provide sufficient capital; to eliminate first
and forever the idea that correct deductions mean sudden riches; to use
brains instead of charts, and common-sense instead of tips; in short,
to apply to speculative ventures the same degree of business foresight
and understanding as would be employed in any other business, the evils
and losses which have always been a part of speculative history, would
be diminished if not eliminated.</p>

suggested as the student progresses and it has been thought best not to
name a large number of books, which might result in confusion as to the
character of the subject matter. The possessor of the works named will
find that he has a very compact, comprehensive and inexpensive little
